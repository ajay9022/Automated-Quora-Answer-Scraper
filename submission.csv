What could I do to avoid this fiasco the next year?']","[""I had 92.86%ile in CAT 2016 and had to lie to friends (they all scored in excess of 98 and I have my own insecurities) that I scored 95%ile. Had only one call SIBM Pune via SNAP(aberration had 99.7ish).\nDidn't attend the interview. Knew I deserved better.\nNMAT QA cutoff not cleared. XAT(2017) 87%ile. Told everyone I scored 96%ile but missed sectional cutoff. IIFT didn't clear multiple sectional cutoffs let alone the overall.\n2017. Only took CAT and XAT(Jan 2018). And the results are as follows:\nToday I have a direct FMS and XLRI converts,and IIM C waitlist(that might not or might not convert) and hoping for a Lucknow convert as well at the time of writing this. Didn't attend Kozhikode Shillong CAP interviews.\nWill be joining FMS Delhi.\nSo here it goes.\nCAT 2017- 99.91%ile with 99.95 in QA. Finished the 34 questions in 50 mins(although the paper was easy this year but still considering it was someone like me,I'll be proud of it).\nI had 68%ile last year in it.\nNow to the more important thing. How I did it.\nFirst things first,know where you're bad at.\nDon't let percentiles fool you. You probably know what you're bad at.\nIt's May. April has ended.\nMay-15th June: No need for mocks. Focus on your weaknesses. Solve everything from basics. Never think “Oh this thing I know already,will skip it”. You have time. Utilise it. Since you can see my weakness is QA I spent 3 months only doing sums and sums and sums. Till 70% of everything came on my fingertips(rest 30% via mocks of course). Buy CL's test gym(irrespective of your weakness). Finish all the advanced level exercises. This will ensure that you'll score 140+ at least on every mock from July onwards (my first mock was on 21st July. Had missed many and everybody told me “omg what are you doing you haven't even started taking mocks? You're already dropping a year” as if that would miraculously improve me without looking at the core problems). Time is your discretion. Since I was awful at maths I just had to put in 6–7 hours every day. If you need time,then give time. You reap what you sow. 1 hour sectional tests a must. At least 1 every day. I know I'm sounding too strict but that 92%ile figure just brings back a lot of memories and I want you to do as well as me if not better.\n15th June-15th July. By now you must've solved your weaknesses till a certain level (if 40+ days can't change that,then you're probably doing it all wrong and time is not on your side). Now general prep(akin to how you prepared for 2017 CAT). Little bit of everything. Get ready for mocks.\nMid July to September. Mocks mocks mocks. 2–3 mocks every week depending upon how your preparation is. A mock is 3 hours long. You'll spend 6 hours at it. 3 hours for analysis. Whatever went wrong better not go wrong in the next mock and every mock should be revised after 10 days or so(my memory retention was really bad so fine-tune all the numerical values according to yourself). You'll see a gradual increase in scores. 120 won't become 180 overnight. My first 180 came in October. CAT scaled score became 207. My first mock I had scored 96%ile on July 21. Simcat 3. 101 score. Highest was 223. Just imagine :) That person unfortunately couldn't convert any of his IIM calls.\nSeptember to October 31st-Chill now. Hard part done. Restrict mocks to once a week. You should be getting 99+ now on an average(you'll reap whatever you sow yet again). Focus on weaknesses again. These 2 months you should absolutely crush your weaknesses (if they're just not going away,maximise strengths and leave them altogether. If they're not happening by now they won't happen with an extra month. Unconventional advice I know,but in the end results matter. Mourinho would agree ;) ). Everything should be solidified now. Don't forget taking mocks and analysing them. It's time to aim 99.8+ and those elusive top 50 all India ranks in mocks.\nNovember 1- Two weeks to CAT. 2–3 mocks per week again. You'll be comfortable with at least 2 sections now with 1 of them pricking you. Mocks now should ensure that you tweak your strategies with respect to D-day and score.\nTwo weeks to CAT to 3 days to CAT- No mocks. Keep your grey cells just fine. Study 2 hours a day now. Read stuff. Calm mind. Revise at least all of the mocks that challenged you (keep a note which did which didn't) and do them. Sectional tests once every 2 days(I took 1 every day but as you can already see I was paranoid. You surely won't have to do 50% of the things I've written. I was dumb and in retrospect would've focused more on GDPI prep haha). Any particular topic bugging you? Be flexible in time and fix it before sleeping on the very same day.\nCAT. My best wishes will be with you!\nI was really really bad. I should be studying in one of those colleges that spam your email all year along if I let myself remain the same as last year.\nI'm sure you can do it. If I can,anyone can. I was the kind who'd struggle reading a paragraph which was anything other than a Chetan Bhagat book or calculating things like 8*12.\nMocks- TIME/IMS/CL. Any 2 of the three. If English is poor then CL+IMS. Otherwise TIME+IMS. (I had all 3 but never used TIME).\nI took 50+ mocks and innumerable sectional tests. I know it sounds excessive,buy hey. I might be in Joka too if my waitlist clears. Otherwise the Red Building of Dreams is there :) Whatever it takes.\nI had no direction in life,was sitting at home hopelessly after graduation so this was my only escape. Sitting on Pagalguy, sitting on the different Facebook groups. CAT prep will always remain special for someone as incompetent as me.\nI'm cent percent sure you are better than me and won't even require half the effort that I had to put in because of me avoiding maths and never reading books all my life.\nYou can do it!!\nIf this answer helps you increase your score by even 20 marks I'll consider it a success"", ""For converting any of the top 10 colleges the safest percentile is 99+. You may convert it at less but the safest is 99+.\nNow coming to my experience, I started preparing for CAT in 3rd year of my engineering, but I was never serious so I ended up missing a lot of classes and was very irregular. Ended up scoring less. Decided to give CAT another attempt and this time promised myself to be serious about it.\nAfter my engineering, I didn't take up a corporate job (had an offer). Instead I started working with my father in our family business and was preparing for CAT alongside.\nI will share my daily routine with you:\nI used to go to work at 10am and return by 5pm or 6pm.\nAfter that from around 7 or 8 I used to start studying till 1 or 2 am.\nI used to give one section test of RC consisting 3 RC passages daily. This was mainly because I was weakest in VA-RC. I used to analysed the RCs and then start with QA and DI/LR on alternate days. I am a moody person so used to study chapters based on my mood. On days when I was too tired I used to solve easy chapters.\nFor vocabulary, in the initial firsts month I started doing 1 or 2 sessions of word power made easy by Norman Lewis and completed it.\nI used to give mocks mainly on weekends. Most of my weekends were spent mainly on giving a mock followed by analysing a mock.\nMy mock analysis would give me all the chapters which I need to study in the coming week.\nI also followed blogs of CATking CAT Blogs and GP ka funda.\nYou can check this study plan : CAT Study Plan It is very comprehensive and nice.\nYou can also follow this youtube channel for more tips :Rahul CATKing Youtube Channel\nLastly, I would say consistency is must!\nThis all worked for me. Hope you benefit from some of it too!"", 'Thanks for A2A Rohit\nHi students!\nI remember a BE senior of mine could not convert any IIM after getting approx 99.7 in CAT long back in 2007. Perhaps he did not have the right confidence and frame of mind going into the BLACKI PI rooms. Last year a student of mine could not convert any IIM despite scoring 98.5+ in CAT. So, first thing first - it happens. Now, the reason behind this is lack of the right mentorship or exposure. Understand exposure and guidance come to those who seek. So, here goes my suggestion for next year:\nTry scoring >92 in CAT. 92 is a very tricky score for the range of colleges that call at that score. IMI, IMT, IRMA,MDI etc. etc. all get most students in the range 88–95. To be on the safer side, try getting 95+. That makes things easier for you.\nNow, coming to the profile part. Make sure your resume looks a clear picture of who you are. Create buckets of whatever achievements you have got till now. Note down the positions of responsibilities that you have held till now. Prepare your projects and subjects well and go into the PI round as an informed and sorted individual who knows all that he has done in life till now.\nBe clear on why do you want your hand to fit in the glove. Lots of students miss the bus because they are not able to link their profile to the college and or stream that they are applying for. Read blogs, sites related to management and build a clear perspective on why MBA and why you think you are good for pursuing MBA? CAT score is not the answer for this - interest in exam itself is also not enough - interest in management has to developed. Your MBA personality has to be nourished right from now. So read, follow and enjoy management stuff in life right from now. Believe that you belong!\nBelieve in yourself. Last time was an experience, this time will be performance! Bounce back with 100% confidence. You will do it then.\nBest wishes\nRahul Sir\nCAT Prep with IIM A alumni', 'Thanks for A2A!\nAs you must have realised by now scoring high in CAT does not guarantee a seat in good B-schools. There are 2 things you can do now to increase your chances of getting selected:\n1.Improve your CAT score to score more in that component of the selection criteria\nThis can be done as follows:\nPreparing in a structured way is what is required! I used the following approach in my prep days which worked wonders for me:\nGive 3–4 mocks in a proper timed manner\nAnalyse all of them together\nSo analyse all the VA sections together, QA sections together and DILR sections together\nTry to see where you are continuously going wrong or missing out in each of the sections\nThose are your weak areas! Work on them in the following way:\nGo to the concept files/lessons, learn the concept\nLearn how to apply them\nPractise, Practise and Practise until you have covered all the varieties of questions and are confident about the topic\n2–3 weeks should be good enough for each of the topics if you give 1/2 hour - 1 hour of time to these weak areas a day for each of the sections\nPost you are done with the weaknesses you can start off with your strengths - only they will take you lesser time and effort\nLater on post 3–4 months you should be over topic wise preps and can start off with mocks which will further solidify your confidence. However, if you do miss out on any question due to not being able to apply the concept you should go back and go through it again!\n2. Improve your overall profile\nDoing online courses pertaining to your interest areas\nFocus on your job - Be informed about what, why and how you are doing the work you are doing!\nJoin an NGO\nReading about your interest areas - happenings, key trends, practises, etc.\nResearch on which domain do you want to pursue\nBeing up-to-date with what is happening in the world\nAll this will help you get ready for the GDPI processes of various B-schools and will help you ace them!\nYou can have a look at the following online courses which are exhaustive in terms of coverage, provides flexibility and includes mentorship:\nCAT 2018 Course\nCAT 2018 Mock Series']"
How should working people aiming to take the CAT manage their preparations with work?,100+ Answers,['Working Professionals Preparing for CAT Exams\nCAT Preparation\nExam Strategies\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should working people aiming to take the CAT manage their preparations with work?'],"[""I graduated now from IIM B. I prepared for CAT while I was working. I used to leave from home by 9.30 - 10 times in morning and be back in home by 9 - 10 after dinner from work. Some days, I had to stay in office late. My work comes under the category of hectic ( mentally, not physically ).\nThis is what I did for the written CAT exam.\nSpend one hour every day in the morning, going through the chapters (Apti, DI, LR). I had materials, and I went chapter by chapter some day and random questions some day. Ensured I solved 20 problems in the beginning and as I progressed the speed increased tremendously.\nIn office, open a browser tab and go to Arts & Letters Daily . Ensured I read three articles each day before I leave office. I'm generally curious, so I would read some random things without any background. Helped a lot in RC.\nThe Hindu, Business standard in browser tab in office. Read in between meetings, when I was distracted etc. But, utilize time in office. Along with wordweb.\nEveryday, walk for 20 minutes or so in the night leisurely and recite to myself\nall multiplication tables ( 1 to 20 )\nSquares of numbers, cubes of numbers\nCalculate % components for 1/2, 1/3 ... 1/15\nTake 5 random numbers and compute their squares and cubes ( short cut ways )\nI know the set of people who are preparing for CAT; we especially had a guy who is very motivated and he would provide us the problems that are challenging & we would spend time discussing quickly. Mostly casual chat types. In our office, it was appreciated to prepare for exams and hence this was easy.\nWeekends, I gave one mock test, either from home or test center. I would try to solve the problem after the exams ( the ones I was not able to find quick solutions for ) & see if there are options. This would be complete in the weekend itself.\nOverall, CAT is about being in touch with the basics. You can solve the paper if you are given twice the time. It is all about speed and accuracy. These will not come unless you are in regular touch. Allot small amounts of time every day and you will surely crack it.\nAll the best for your CAT...!!!"", ""IT IS NOT AT ALL DIFFICULT. Period. Always keep this in mind.\nCAT is an exam for which you need not put in several hours of preparation daily for months. Your preparation and performance will depend A LOT on where you stand right now. If someone is comfortable with Maths, Reasoning and/or English already, the entire preparation will revolve more around developing speed and polishing the strategy with which one approaches the paper. However, CAT is not that easy either, it is not the paper that makes this exam tough but rather, the high amount of competition.\nNote that, the major constraint for us here is TIME. So, we’ll try and do these 2 things -\nReduce investing time in unnecessary activities other than what’s really important.\nThe time that we invest in CAT prep, it must have high RoI. (So, no reading newspapers, past papers, old mock tests etc)\nKeeping this in mind, these are some key points (in no specific order) which will help you in preparing for CAT alongside working -\nGet hold of study material from any institute and make sure that you go through at least QA and LR from start to end ASAP. This is extremely important.\nA very important thing (that most people don't do) is that every time you try and solve questions, do it with time limit. It will be much more effective if you get used to solving questions in time limit from day 1.\nTry and manage 3 hours at least on alternate days, this will be needed when you write mock tests on weekdays.\nTry and utilise your travel time to office for revision. Maintain a thick notebook with all the QA formulas/tricks and LR concepts/tricks and keep updating it with every mock/sectional test you give.\nMental calculations are very important. Practice this all the time, even while working.\nInstead of investing time in novels/newspapers, invest that same amount of time in solving RC passages on various themes and topics (With a time limit of course). This way, you'll practice a lot of reading as well as you'll also practice spotting answers for questions.\nTake mock test very seriously, and its analysis even more seriously. Write a mock only if you’re sure that you can focus. Do not write a mock when you’re super tired or are sure that you’ll be disturbed in between. More importantly, focus a lot on the analysis part. Identify where you went wrong. Go through the solution of the test thoroughly and write all the new formulae/tricks mentioned in the ‘thick notebook’ mentioned above.\nOnce you start mocks, maintain an excel sheet to keep track of questions in VA and QA topic wise. After every mock, during analysis, just fill this excel sheet.\nAt the end, apply a formula that will give you details about % attempt (Attempt/Total*100) and % accuracy (Correct/Ateempt*100) topic wise. After 10-15 mocks, you'll be very clear about which topic you are attempting less, where your accuracy is pathetic etc etc. It will help you much more than you realise.\nDO NOT try to do too many things. Someone will try and do mocks, various books from Indian authors, even GMAT books, then lots of reading, then improve grammar with several grammar improvement books, then vocab improvement books, solving questions on Pagalguy, solving questions on various sites, various study materials etc etc etc. KEEP IT SIMPLE. Don't get caught up with all this. Don't ask for too many suggestions. Talk to a few good people, make a good plan that you feel will work for you and just do it.\nMaximise your efforts during the weekends, significantly reduce hanging out with friends, movies etc.\nSTOP WASTING TIME.\nTrust me, it is not difficult at all. I too did it in my first CAT attempt. I had an extremely demanding on-field job as a construction engineer and was able to spare only 2-3 hours per day 6 days a week for the preparation. On Friday (Weekend in Algeria), I used to study for around 6-8 hours. As this was my first attempt, I had to start from scratch. Moreover, I didn’t have any books or materials with me to study from so I had to look for concepts and questions on the internet. All the best.\nNEVER SETTLE"", ""CAT is very difficult to handle with 9 to 6 job, but it has to be done. I started my CAT preparation after I completed 2 years at work and finally nailed it with 1.5 years of preparation. I have experienced how difficult it is to maintain work-life balance. Thus, preparing CAT along with work is next to impossible for many. Thus, it leads to two extreme steps. Either the aspirant leaves his job or he leaves his dream of an IIM tag.\nLeaving the job for CAT is too risky because of the unpredictability of the exam. If you are thinking of taking the other step, then this post is not for you. You may scroll down to read some other post.\nI am assuming the following conditions are satisfied to follow the steps mentioned in this post:\n1. Saturday & Sunday off. (Weekend off)\n2. Total time 12 hours outside the home. (Office + travel time + etc.)\n3. You have only one goal in your life and i.e. CAT.\nSome of you may get off on some other days or work unevenly on various days. So for the people whom the above assumptions are not valid. Please accommodate the schedule as per your ease.\n1. Treat each section equally: - Considering the increasing difficulty level of DI & LR with every passing year and high unpredictability of VA, do not live under the veil that you can cover one section with another. Focus on all the sections.\n2. Weekdays: - On weekdays allocate 6 (8-2 = 6) hrs. for studying (2 hrs. for each of the four sections mentioned below)\n(i) QA: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals/books. You can use any of the two mocks (IMS, Time).\n(ii) DI/LR: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals. You can use any of the three mocks (IMS, CL, Time). Practice as many sets as you can.\n(iii) VA/RC: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals. IMS mocks provides you the closest RC that you may get in CAT. You can practice from Time also but RC from Time is a bit lengthy and contains a bit easier question. The VA/RC section of last two years CAT was most similar to IMS mocks. You can use office time to practice old mocks, sectional, etc. (Given you utilize the time judiciously. Trust me, it is achievable.)\n(iv) Newspaper Reading (The Hindu Editorial): - This should be finished at the office. Do not carry this task to home. 9 to 6 job provides you enough free time to read the newspaper. If you do not get enough time during lunch or while traveling, then you can follow other alternatives. Copy the editorial/article and paste it in either XLSX or notepad and read it. This way you will be at your cubicle and can utilize your time well. Do this whenever you get free time. Don't restrict yourself to only newspaper and diversify your readings.\n3. Weekends/Holidays: - On weekends/ holidays allocate minimum 12.5 hrs. for studying.\n(i) 7.5 hrs. for studying (2.5 hrs. to each section).\n(ii) 3 hrs. for mock.\n(iii) 2 hrs. for mock analysis.\n4. Till August: - You should finish QA theory & formulas, all concepts of DI & LR and the basic understanding of different question types in VA & RC.\n5. September & October: -\n(i) You should only do revision and attempt mocks and sectionals.\n(ii) You Should give at least 2 mocks each weekend with their analysis. Do not miss any center-based mocks. Attempt them at the center to prepare yourself for the exam like scenarios. (It will make you feel comfortable on D day).\n6. Last month (November): -\n(i) 1 mock each day and along with its analysis.\n(ii) I would advise taking a month leave before CAT. If it is not possible then take at least 2 weeks off before the exam and give mocks at exactly the exam time.\n7. Meanwhile, take out time to pursue your hobbies. Keep in mind CAT is not the end, it is just the beginning of your DREAM.\nAll the Best. Please feel free to ask any query in the comment section.\nTo get answer of all other Query Please Join.\nLog into Facebook | Facebook"", 'Given the changing nature of CAT (which at a fundamental level has remained more or less the same) and the preparation required to \'crack\' an exam of this kind, planning becomes extremely important in addition to the natural skillset.\n\nConsidering you have taken CAT 2015, you are now aware of three things:\n1. Verbal preparation is not really prep prep but something that needs to be done over a long period\n2. Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation requires vast exposure to different kind of questions and logic(s)\n3. A simple formula based approach and sticking to level of difficulty 1-2-3 in Quant is good enough\n\nAlso read: Prasad Sawant\'s answer to Does CAT 2015 Stands a benchmark for future test pattern?\n\nWhen you are taking a second attempt at a test like this, your preparation strategy is quite different from your first attempt strategy.\n\nFirst attempt is like learning how to swim. You flounder, you need help, your strokes are without finesse and you somehow manage to stay afloat. And unless you do that, you don\'t reach the next level. But once you have learned what\'s required, you become better. Then you focus on cutting the water at a certain angle, perfecting your strokes, increase your lung capacity and strength, and finally, you become a good swimmer.\n\nComing back to your question, let\'s start planning your day:\nWork day: 24 hours - (9 hours of work, 2 hours of travel, 7 hours of sleep, 2 hours of food, 2 hours of buffer time spent on in-between activities & fun) = 2 hours\nNon-work day: 24 hours - (10 hours of sleep, 2 hours of food, 5 hours of buffer time spent on in-between activities & fun) = 7 hours\n\nAssuming you are dedicated enough, you will roughly have about 24 hours per week for preparation. This time can be divided as (Strong section: 7 hours, Moderate section: 8 hours, ""I-am-not-good-at-this"" section: 9 hours)\n\nPreparation means: Understanding concepts + solving questions without time limit/with time limit. One of the biggest mistakes before the second attempt is confusing familiarity and conceptual clarity. In the first six months of the calendar year, focus on preparation. In the remaining five months, focus on mocks and test taking strategy and practice.\n\nThe reason why I am not sharing a time table and talking broadly in terms of hours is because I think everyone is different and needs to have a custom plan. Only you can draft that for yourself. The next thing is to sustain the motivation and having a discipline to stick to that plan (DIFFICULT part)\n\nPost June/July, you should not feel the need to go back to the concepts book. The idea of putting more hours in the first six months is to reduce to effort required in the second half. People start getting serious 2 months before the CAT when it\'s already late. Then nothing helps.\n\nAlso, before you start your plan for CAT 2016, sit and do a thorough analysis of your last year preparation and performance. What different things are you going to do this time to ensure a significantly better result?\n\nCreate a monthly plan which is further divided in weeks and days. Keep a little buffer in case a topic is difficult to understand or long. Extreme specificity might not be required (for e.g. morning 30 minutes on 27th January for understanding sum of roots from algebra) but a broad topic wise and section wise plan is better.\n\nOnce the plan is in place, understand what material will help you achieve it. Coaching institute material + past papers + 2-3 good books should suffice. Apart from that, focus on reading anything and everything to improve your VA RC skills and Puzzles and brain teasers to improve your overall aptitude.\n\nIf you have specific things to ask, you can always message me. Hope this helps. All the best.']"
How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?,100+ Answers,['Prepathon\nExam and Test Results\nCommon Admission Test Percentiles\nPercentile\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExams and Tests\nHow did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?'],"['My authority on the subject? I scored a 99.75 percentile in CAT, 99.55 in XAT, 99.45 in SNAP. This is a walkthrough of my preparation/ how you can go about preparing for CAT and other entrance exams.\nCAT is considered to be one of the most difficult entrance exams in India, but it is isn’t as difficult as it’s made out to be. Most of the topics that are tested in CAT are High school level topics. The difficulty lies in the fear of the test. Most CAT aspirants resign to an assumption that they can’t score above a certain percentile without even knowing what the test is made off, half the game is lost at this point.\nI have been guilty of the same myself. Jan 2016, I remember looking at lists of MBA colleges and immediately rejecting the top 30 odd colleges for the fact that they all required you to score above 97 percentile or so to realistically make into those colleges. It was only when I talked to my father and he explained to me the negativity in my thinking, that I realised, I hadn’t even seen what CAT consisted of. I had no logic in leaving out the possibility of scoring an extremely high percentile.\nAnother reason why I felt that I had to score an extremely high percentile were my 12th class marks. MBA colleges give weightage to academic profile. A self-analysis made me realise that having a low score in my 12th class (69%) was a huge handicap. If I had got a low percentile I would’ve found it extremely difficult to make into the colleges of the relevant level. I would’ve ended up in colleges ranked even lower. I had to score a 99+ percentile. BELIEVE you can Crack the CAT\nHow to go about:\nI have divided the preparation for CAT into four parts:\nPre-preparation, Preparation, Practice, Taking the CAT\nPre-Preparation\nThere are a few things you’ll want to have in place before you start your preparation for CAT and other exams.\nFind three hours a day (not in bits and pieces here and there) three continuous hours to prepare. This can be extremely difficult if you are working/ attending college. This might help you to find a few extra hours a day.\nGet rid of any distractions that you believe affect your concentration or mental state in general. (social media is one of the biggest time-suck and tends to distract you even if you aren’t online)\nGet in touch with someone who has cracked the entrance exam or has some expertise in the same, you could approach a local coaching centre. (you may not enrol as a full-time student but you would want to be in touch with the faculty there by buying their material or tests etc.) This will be helpful in getting certain finner tips and in case you have difficulties.\nGet yourself a campaign manager. Cracking the CAT and getting an admission into an MBA college is a long drawn process. You are bound to lose interest or forget important things/ deadlines. Get someone who will keep track of the same. For me, it was my father who helped me keep track of my preparation and all the college applications. Make sure the person you chose exactly understands the process and understands what you want. They will make sure that you are still going even when the motivation starts to run out.\nRead a lot. This is extremely important when it comes to the verbal ability section of CAT. You will need a lot of broad-based readings and an ability to make sense of what you have read quickly. The passages for reading comprehension in CAT are sometimes extremely abstract and can be extremely difficult to make sense if you aren’t used to reading a lot. Places where you should want to read from: Medium, The guardian, Businessweek Bloomberg, Also read some classic novels that you can lay your hands on, the books talked about on crash course literature are a good place to start.\nPreparation\nCAT is divided into 3 sections verbal ability reading comprehension, logical reasoning data interpretation, and quantitative ability. Each of the sections requires equal effort and attention.\nTime for preparation: There are many people and sites who will tell you that you need 14 hours a day to prepare for CAT. Trust me that doesn’t work. You just need 3 to 4 hours a day consistently over a period of 3- 4 months to crack CAT. Anything more than 5 hours a day can and will burn you out.\nSource material for preparation: A common mistake that most aspirants will make is relying on just one book/ one source for preparation (particularly anyone who takes coaching). It is recommended that you have access to at least some material from different authors. This will provide you with multiple points of view for the same problems. (same goes for mock tests recommended that take at least 4 to 5 tests from A differen source).\nVerbal Ability & Reading Comprehension\nThis is one of the most frustrating sections in CAT. The question often can seem to have multiple solutions and where options are provided all of them seem correct. Even if you are extremely good with English you can end up messing this section.\nThe key to cracking this section (particularly Verbal ability part) is understanding that this section is more about logic than language. You have to understand the logic as to how the solutions are arrived at (jumbled para is the killer in this section).\nI initially worked this section by looking at the solutions, that way I was able to see what patterns to look out for and what logic to apply.\nWork on improving your ability to comprehend complex /long sentences, particularly from topics that you aren’t used to and having complex vocabulary.\nThis section will take a lot of practice to master, more practice than the other two sections. This section has the highest returns for scores. If you get a slightly higher score in this section your percentile can increase drastically. (I scored a 99.98 percentile in this section).\nEven if you have a good command over the language DO NOT take this section lightly, I know of aspirants who have the CAT along with me having excellent command over the language yet messing up this section completely.\nData interpretation and logical reasoning\nData interpretation is a practice intensive section. There is nothing new that you have to learn in this section. It is just the ability to carry out basic calculations using tools you already have (percentages, averages, summation, division). Practice these basic tools thoroughly so that you are extremely comfortable with them. Also get acquainted with all the various forms of data presentation, such as graphs, pie charts, tables, caselets etc.\nLogical reasoning is a section which you should and can make the most out of it. The questions are very often similar. While practising logical reasoning the things you would want to learn is gauging the difficulty of the question quickly. If a question is difficult, move on to the next one (time is important).\nYou would want to practice visualising the problem (in mind / on paper ) in the simplest way possible. This will help you breakdown huge paragraphs full of seemingly meaningless words into sensible data.\nLearn to have an unbiased mind. One of the mistakes you can make in this section is assume somehting that isnt true. Learn to use all the information provided and only than make any conclusion.\nRead the data carefully a single word can change the whole situation. (for ex. XYZ is not wearing a black pant. can easily be mistaken for XYZ wearing a pant if you miss out on the not.)\nQuantitative ability\nThis is one of the more easier sections to get by, You just have to understand the concepts behind all the topics involved. Again the topics in this section are high school level math. You can over prepare for this section and most aspirants do.\nThere are certain topics in this section that you would want to be extremely thorough with since they appear most frequently (going by the trends of past so many years), such as time speed distance, time work, Geometry, Functions.\nYou would want to also be thorough with averages alligations, percentages ratios since these topics are more helpful in DI section but very rarely make an appearance as stand-alone questions in QA section.\nNumber systems personally I felt for me was an extremely overrated topic ( I spent way more time than required here)\nPractice\nTaking mock tests, I feel mock tests will be the most important part of your preparation as they help you guage exactly where you stand. (another benefit is to know which colleges you should apply to).\nWhat is a good number of mock tests to take? There isn’t any concensus on this topic, there are CAT toppers who got by on hardly any mock tests, and than there are people like me who took close 40 mock tests.\nPersonally mock tests where the biggest source of practice for me. I took mock tests from 3 different sources. ( I recommend atleast 2 different sources). Once you have taken a mock test it’s extremely important that you analyse them well, I spent about an hour and half after every mock test to analyse where I have gone wrong and what can be changed. Mock tests are also a good time to test out strategies in handling various sections. (I will try to come with a detailed post about analysing mock tests.)\nI will boast a little here, but thanks to the trends on my mock tests I was extremely confident of getting the percentile I got on CAT. ( I expected at least a 99.5 %le)\nI recommend practicing during the time slot you will actually be answering the CAT, I had to take the CAT on a sunday in the morning slot (9.30 to 12.30) at a centre 30 kms away from home. Considering the reporting time of an extra hour, I would have to technically leave my house at 7 in the morning on the day of the test. I usually get hungry within 2 and half hours of eating anything. So in the month before CAT I trained my body, by having breakfast at 6 in the morning and not having anything till 1pm. I also trained myself to sit at one place for 4 hours (830 to 1230). This may seem funny/ unnecessary but on the day of the test you dont want to have any other factors troubling you.\nTaking the CAT\nTry to stop preparation for CAT at least 3 days before CAT (there are people who will disagree and reccommend you remain in the mood and keep preparing) anything you try to “prepare” during these last days often will be of very little help. Don’t wander away from the CAT mood though, read or at least make sure you are sitting 3 hours at a place for these last few days ( to stay in the CAT mood).\nDo not take a mock test in the few days before CAT, If you mess the mock it is likely that you will panic on the day of the CAT.\nDo not keep any expectations as to the number of questions you want to complete in each section.\nAll the best for your preparation for CAT.\nP.S. CAT isn’t everything, CAT is hardly a learning experience, you won’t learn anything new as such (well other than how to prepare hard) it’s mostly about things you already know, taking the CAT can hence be a very frustrating experience. I recommend that you learn something else too on the side lines, get a hobby or hold a job (again debatable as to how much time you can find etc.) If you are taking drop read a lot, read all the books you can get your hands on. All in all try to do something else too that will help you grow.\nBelling the CAT and other entrance exams', 'This answer is fairly long, about 7000 words. So I have divided my answer into 9 parts wherein each part can be read independently. However reading the entire answer in one go will serve as RC practice, so that would be advisable.\nWhat I have mentioned below helped me in my journey from 66% -> 99.85% in CAT. I have tried my level best to be as detailed as possible. GK as a section is not there in CAT as of now but is very important in the other papers like XAT, IIFT, SNAP, etc. So, I have included that as well. I have also put in a little bit about how to attempt mocks and then analyse them to improve further. A little bit on GD-PI-WAT as well, so that this answer serves all your needs.\nI would like to point out that I have been an average student all my life and am a GEM (General Engineer Male), yes pun intended. My 10/12/B.Tech scores are 83/79/66. With that I made it to IIM Calcutta, so the first thing that you should now do is stop worrying about your previous grades. 99% of the people reading this will surely have better grades. So, if I can you obviously can get through and study at an IIM.\nMy CAT 2015 score card:\nQA: 99.8%\nLRDI: 99.96%\nVA: 87.33%\nOA: 99.85%\nThis answer is divided into the following parts:\nA.) How to start?\nB.) QA -> Quantitative Ability\nC.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning\nD.) VA -> Verbal Ability\nE.) GK -> General Knowledge\nF.) How to attempt mocks? (Non-CAT exams at the end)\nG.) How to analyse mocks?\nH.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?\nI.) GD-PI-WAT prep\nA.) How to start CAT prep?\nRegister at any site which lets you attempt and review a mock for free. You could try hitbullseye. If you have already enrolled for a test series or for a classroom programme, then attempt one of their mocks. Many of you would be like bhai abhi toh padhai start bhi nahi ki, mock deke kya hoga aur upar se aadhe questions toh samajh bhi nahi aayenge aur maths ke formula bhi yaad nahi hain. Additionally while attempting the mock, there will be multiple instances when you will feel like getting up because you are not used to solving questions for 3 hours at a stretch. Your brain will also try to deceive you into grabbing your smart phone for checking Whatsapp. You will feel like drinking water, you will also be tempted to check FB. The point of this test is to make sure that all this doesn’t happen when you actually attempt CAT. Now you would be thinking what is the point in attempting a mock when I don’t know $hi+.Precisely my point! The main reason for this mock was to identify what you know, what you don’t, where you stand and how much hard work is required.\nOnce you are done with the mock, check the solutions and find the topics which you already know, which you attempted correctly. Some problems would have been there which you would have been sure of but you got them wrong because you were out of touch and forgot the formula or recalled an incorrect formula. You probably forgot the plural of fish. Fish or fishes? Or does it depend on whether I am talking about a species of fish or multiple units of the same species? Then you will realise that a little brush up of a few topics (which you are out of touch with) will dramatically improve your score. Work on these topics first and then move on to topics which you have no clue about. This mock decides your future course of study.\nNow, on to the preparation phase.\nB.) QA -> Quantitative Ability\nStart off with this site. http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/Click on start and then check your score. You know where you stand. Keep practising a few times every day and your score will keep improving. If you can hit 50-55 consistently in the default 120 seconds, you will easily hit 99.5% in CAT in this section.\nIf you are targeting 99.5+ then I would also like you to memorise the following:\nB1.) Reciprocals, Squares and Cubes up till 30.\nPay attention here, some values will get repeated.\nAs for 1/7. Remember that it is .142857. For other go up to 2-3 decimals,whatever you are comfortable with. I would prefer 3 decimals though.\nB2.) Power of 2 up till 12\nPower of 3 up till 8\nPower of 4 up till 6\nPower of 5-6 up till 5\nPower of 7-10 up till 4\nPower of 11-13 up till 3\nAgain same as above. Some values will be the same. 4^6 has already been covered till 2^12 and so on. Don’t just mug up blindly, pay attention to the numbers.\nB3.) Square Root up till 10\nB4.) Factorial up till 10\nB1-B4: Now most of you would be like, dude they give an inbuilt calculator. But then other exams don’t have that calculator. Additionally who do you think will take lesser time in solving a question? A person who uses the calculator for finding 12^3 or someone who just knows it is 1728. Believe me when I say that this is very important for your LRDI section as well. This will decide whether you get stuck at 99.5% or go beyond that. This is the deciding factor. Please memorise these values.\nB5.) A few important numbers like 999=27*37, 1001=7*11*13, 21^3=9261.\nB6.) Some numbers have the property wherein the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the no itself. 1, 2, 145 and 40585. Please remember these.\nB7.) There are 15 primes till 50, 25 till 100, 46 till 200 and 168 till 1000.\nB8.) How to find the sum of the first n natural nos. Sum of squares of n natural nos. Sum of cubes, sum of 4th powers. Please remember the formulas. Specially the last one (fourth power), most people forget that.\nB9.) Scale is not allowed in any of the exams. What the CAT authorities mean is that the scale which we used back in school that is not allowed. They never said anything about using your hand as a scale. Check the length of your fingers. Also check the length of the 3 sub division on your fingers. Use your right or left hand, whatever suits you. Please make sure that you remember these values by heart. These values will help you solve 90% of the geometry questions. Also, buy a protractor and make sure you can make the angles 30, 45, 60, 90 properly. First with the protractor and then without it. Based on the question, make a rough figure. Then based on your lengths, find the answer and then scale up to the value given in the question. Geometry has a lot of formulas, memorize them or use this approach. Approximation ftw!\nB.10.) Unitary Method. Make sure you are good with this, half the QA syllabus can be solved using unitary method. Do you think whatever has been mentioned in B9 is basically Unitary Method at the end for getting the answer?\nMost of the students go for solving the maximum no of problems. Don’t do that. Focus on the basics, don\'t go for solving questions directly like most students. Most students don’t score 99+. You are different, work differently. This is how you should be doing it for any given chapter day wise. First day go after the formulas and try to understand why a certain formula is there. Make sure that you have memorised all the formulas for that chapter. If you were to set the paper, what could be a possible question? Read a formula, try to frame questions on that formula and then memorize the formula. Just memorizing all formulas in one go won\'t help, because you will probably forget. If you can do this, then you would have solved all the questions by the time you finish reading the theory.\nExample: Let\'s say you are studying Numbers. You see the formulas for HCF and LCM of 2 nos. Then you see the factors of a number. Now think of possible questions on this. Let\'s say 72.\n1.) How many odd factors are there?\n2.) How many even factors are there?\n3.) What is the sum of the odd factors?\n4.) What is the sum of the even factors?\n5.) What is the product of the odd factors?\n6.) What is the product of the even factors?\n7.) How many factors are squares of natural numbers?\n8.) How many factors are cubes of natural numbers?\nGood going, you just completed half the chapter! Similarly think of more questions that you can make. The exercise at the end is filled with such questions. It depends on your thinking. Focus on this. If basics are fine,questions won\'t be a problem.\nWould you memorize 456*876 and 235*9865 and things like that or learn how multiplication works?\nIf you think that you lack imagination when it comes to maths and can’t do the above, then no problem. As mentioned above, by the end of the first day you would be done with memorising all the formulas. That’s it. Don’t solve anything. Just make sure all the formulas are deeply rooted in your brain and you can recall them anytime you want. Now take a break for a day. On the 3rd day, start solving problems. But remember that you are to solve by recalling the formula not by turning over the pages and looking at the formula. If you cannot recall, then please make sure you memorize the formulas again. Solve a few problems. Take a day’s break and continue solving on the 5th and similarly on the 7th day as well. This way apart from the formula getting imprinted in your brain multiple times, you will also understand which formulas are asked more often than others. Some chapters are connected to one another. Make groups of such chapters. If working on a group, try to complete all the topics in that group. For example:\nRatio Proportion, Unitary Method, Percentage, Profit and Loss.\nSimple equations, Simultaneous equations, Inequalities, Time speed distance and work, Quadratic.\nProgression.\nNumbers, Bases, Miscellaneous equations.\nSurds and Indices, Logarithms.\nMensuration.\nGeometry.\nCoordinate Geometry.\nProbability and PnC.\nFunctions and Graphs.\nFor people trying to clear the cut off in this section. The first 3 with mensuration and a bit of geometry/numbers will be enough.\nC.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning\nData Interpretation is speed and practise. The site mentioned in the Quant region and B1-B4 there would be of immense help. These will increase your speed. Generally each and every DI set has at least a problem on percentage or ratio.\nToday when you start, start off with the sole intention of solving all the questions of a given set. When you can do that on a daily basis. Move to 2 sets a day. When you can do that. Move to 3 sets daily and then to 4 sets. Keep solving as many questions as you can. Time taken per question will decrease with practise. A few months after you were born, you started to crawl, then you started walking and finally you started running. Same thing here. Don’t think about speed now. Speed comes gradually. Let nature take its course.\nLogical Reasoning, as the name suggests is based on how well you can interpret and analyse things. LR checks your thought process, it checks how you tackle problems. Get this book ""Puzzles"" by George J. Summers. When you watch a football match, why do you watch it? Probably because you want your team to win or you want to see a good contest and enjoy. Similarly, once you have bought this book, think about your objective. It’s not about getting the correct solution, it’s about improving your thought process. And additionally the puzzles in this book are tough. You could think of it as the daddy of Irodov. Engineers will get the joke! You won’t be able to solve most of the problems and frankly speaking I don’t expect you to. However, what I do expect from you is to read a question. Try to understand what has been given. Try to understand what is being asked. Think about it for say 10-15 minutes. Write down whatever approach you can think of. If you could not solve it, look at the hints and their solution scheme. Were you thinking in the right direction?Analyse the difference between the method given in the book and your method.Try to understand what you missed because of which you could not solve the puzzle. Try again for 30 minutes. If you can solve it, good enough, if not maybe try again. After a few more tries look at the solution. Remember you bought the book to improve your thought process, not to solve each question in the first attempt. Trying a puzzle for 5 minutes and then looking at the solution will take you nowhere. Solving again and again till the time you get the answer is what the book was bought for. To make sure that you can think and get the answer on your own. The answer at the end is just for verification. 1-2 puzzles a day. 3 at max, not more than that. You have to improve your thought process,not complete the book as fast as possible. Your scores in the LR section will improve in a month’s time and then it will stay at 99%.\nAnother very important point would be to memorize the alphabet-number conversion table. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. You will come across questions on this in your mocks as well as in the exams.\nD.) VA -> Verbal Ability\nI had 69 and 72 in English in 10 and 12 respectively. My verbal score in CAT went up from 43 -> 87%. Whatever I have written below is what I did to make sure that I cleared the verbal cut off comfortably. If you are looking at a 99+verbal score, then you would be better off by reading the other answers to this question for improving your verbal section. This part is not for you kindly move on to the LRDI section. If you however $uck at English just like me, then this just might help you in clearing the sectional cut off. I tried memorizing words from the GRE word list. My language skills were not good enough to use words like persiflage, perspicuous, ubiquitous, scintillating, etc. in sentences. So, I would keep memorizing and then keep forgetting these words. I had never read novels so I had never come across such words as well. So, I came to the conclusion that memorising words won’t help me. But, a decent vocabulary is needed for CAT. So, I bought this book “Word Power Made Easy” by Normal Lewis. Managed to complete the chapters in a few months. I didn’t do the word list at the end. I would request you to buy this book and complete the chapters.\nAnother thing that seemed obvious to me was that whether you look at RCs or Para Jumbles or Para Completion or Para Summary. All these have basically been written by some person who had a very good command over the English language. So all these things should logically have a flow of thought with which the author would have written the entire thing. You just have to understand that flow. If you can understand an RC, then understanding a paragraph from that RC will obviously be very easy for you. Think about it, a PJ or a PC or a PS are basically paragraphs taken from an RC. You just have to understand the flow in which the entire thing was written by some person who had a decent understanding of the English language. But, then I again had a problem. The Verbal section in CAT was supposed to be of 1 hour and as soon as I would start reading an RC, 8-10 minutes down the line I would feel drowsy. I would start thinking about checking FB or Whatsapp or practically doing anything apart from reading that stupid RC. All those Speed reading techniques, skimming, reading the question first and all. None of that mattered. I understood what my problem was. COMPREHENSION and CONCENTRATION. By the time I was in the 2nd para I would have forgotten what was written in the 1st para. It’s called a READING COMPREHENSION for a reason. Never trade comprehension for speed.\nHow to improve comprehension and concentration?\n\nBoth will improve gradually with time. First step is to make sure that you don’t feel drowsy when reading for an hour. You will be required to do that in the exam. So you need to build your stamina to concentrate. Start off by reading 2-3k word long articles on News, sport and opinion from the Guardian\'s global edition | The Guardian. Register on the website and you will get a mail every morning at 10am. Read all the articles from there. Make sure you read at a stretch for an hour. Read everything from Culture to Technology to Art to Literature. In the beginning you will feel sleepy within a few minutes of starting. Slowly you will gain rhythm. Within 15 days you will be able to read 1 hour at a stretch. In a month’s time you will start retaining information as well. Then focus on just 1 category every day. Like only Philosophy or only Art or only culture. With that your stamina and concentration will increase further and since you are reading about only 1 thing for 1 hour, your knowledge in that topic will also increase. This can be done at home, but preferably in office to better utilize your time. PJ PC PS are all extensions of an RC. All will seem easy once you are comfortable with RCs. Here News, sport and opinion from the Guardian\'s global edition | The Guardian you will be reading 2000-3000 word long articles. Once you are used to this, 500-600 word passages in CAT and other exams will be a piece of cake for you!\nFor verbal, always eliminate choices and then mark rather than directly trying to find the correct answer. This section is different from the other sections,so it has to be dealt in a different manner. Please eliminate choices and then answer. If in doubt, leave. As for the grammar section, I have no idea when to use have and when to use has. Same with is/are and things like that. Neither can I spot grammatical errors in sentences. So, I mostly leave such questions.But I always read them. You can always answer a few of them based on instinct. Some sitters are always there in every paper.\nE.) GK -> General Knowledge\nAll the papers except CAT have this section. Some have a sectional cut off,some don’t. This section can be answered in about 5 minutes. It has the highest marks/min for any section. This section is the key to a high percentile. This section will give you the points for speaking in a GD and PI and also for writing in WAT. So, if you plan on getting through to a good B-School don’t ignore it. There would be 2 methods to prepare for this.\nE1.) Start reading any newspaper. Go through the headlines and all. Make sure you are updated with what is happening in the country. After a week or so, you will realise that it’s mostly the same thing that keeps getting repeated everyday in the paper. Think of it from the point of view of the exam. There will be MCQs. So they won’t ask for your opinion on Kejriwal vs Modi. Leave all the pages on politics. That’s sheer wastage of time. Don’t waste time on that stuff! Make sure you remember the schemes which Mr Modi keeps rolling out. At least remember the important ones. Did any big firm buy another one? Any Indian who won some award abroad. Who won which Grand Slam? Who won the Pulitzer Prize? Who won the Arjuna Khel Ratna Award? India is working on the Chabahar port with which country? Malcom Turnbull is from which country? I think you would have understood what is expected from you. MBA is about business. Focus on economic and business news more than others. Noble Prize in economics fort his year? How many Deputy Governors are there in the Reserve Bank? Make a doc file with these details. You file would look somewhat like this.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document...\nThis is what I had made for this year, so no this won’t help you! You will have to make one with the current affairs of this year. Since you will be working the entire year making this, so by the time the exams are a week away, you will have such a file. You might however think that this is too much work. In that case I would suggest you try the second and relatively easier method compared to this.\nE2.) Whichever is the first exam for you which will have a GK section, keep 4 days before that exam for making this file and memorizing it. Gather all the monthly booklets which are given to Time students. Each book has about 100 questions. Memorize the ones you think are important. CL and Time both will also have a few sheets on GK, current affairs, etc. Get those as well. CL GK compendium. Hitbullseye gk pdfs are also there. You can get most of these online for free or search on Pagalguy, someone would have uploaded it there for sure. Whatever you think is important, please memorize that. 4 days is more than enough to complete all the material I have mentioned above. By going through the monthly magazines you will also be able to keep track of what is happening in India and also round the globe.\nThe regular reading (The first method, reading daily) means that when the exam sare about to start, you would have completed most of the things. The last 4 days will serve as a revision for you. I did both the above things. So if you have time go for it. A close friend of mine, Prateek, he was preparing for UPSC. He was of immense help! Whenever I would meet him, we would talk about how things going on in our country. Served as revision for him and I would stay updated with facts. So, if you can find someone who is preparing for UPSC religiously,i t would be great. You will also have a contact who is an IAS officer. If you want to score even higher in GK get a small yearbook from some shop. Small ones general contain 100 odd pages, going through that will serve as revision as well.\nF.) How to attempt mocks (Non-CAT exams at the end)\n\nThe first step here is to make sure that you can sit and concentrate properly for 3 hours at a stretch. FB, Whatsapp, drowsiness, drinking water or the sudden urge to go to the washroom during these 3 hours have to be removed.Kindly take care of such things which might disturb you, especially the last 2 and then start a mock. When you are attempting the mock, the only thing in your mind should be about maximising your score! Another point that you should keep in mind in that no one cares about what you know and what you don’t. The only thing that matters is your score. So please keep your ego aside when attempting the paper. Yeh question kaise nahi bana, kal hi toh banaya tha and then you spend the next 15 mins on it and still end up marking the wrong answer. Please don’t! You have a fight with your girlfriend and then you are like “I am not texting her first”. Yes I was talking about that very ego of yours, please get rid of it when you are attempting a mock. If you can’t solve a question then please move on to the next one. The examination hall is not the place to derive a formula and then solve the concerned problem. Anyways, I could go on but I think I have made my point.\nRemember that half the paper is very easy, mostly formula based. Your approach should be to attempt these questions first. Make sure that you have touched the 97-98% mark and then move on to the difficult questions for improving your score.\nF1.) QA -> Quantitative Ability\n\nYou are not supposed to start from question no 1 and then continue till 34. Most of the times you will not even be able to look at some of the problems in the end. So we will follow a Round by round approach. About 50% of the problems are direct formula based. When you start this section (Round 1), keep the above point in mind. So, as soon as you look at a question. Can you solve it in a minute by using a formula? If the question with a formula was given to a 5th grader, would he be able to solve it. If yes, then solve this question. Use the values given in the question, get the answer and then move on to the next question. If you see a question and you are like, yaar yeh toh banaya hua hai, 2-3 min lagega, lamba question hai. Or if you are like sirf cases likhne hain, phir count kar lunga, phir answer. Such questions which you know you can solve but are not direct formula based, are to be left out now. These have to be attempted in the 2nd round. Getting my point? If formula based, then attempt else next. Within 30 minutes you should have attempted about 16-17 questions and you would have seen all the questions. That will get you at least 97-98% in this section.\nNow Round 2, there were a few questions which you had seen earlier and were pretty confident about. This is where your brain will help you. The human mind is so awesome that even though you just looked at it once but solved different questions and totally forgot about it, you brain was working on that question subconsciously without you having any idea about it. Now, when you read the question, you will take a lesser amount of time to solve it compared to what you would have taken had you solved it in the first round itself. You could go for Round 3 as well, your choice! But 2 rounds are needed. Please stop with a single round method which most of you are used to now.\nWhy this approach?\nMany people are most often not able to see the entire paper,so they miss sitters. This round by round technique helps you go through the entire paper and thereby select the easiest ones which in turn maximises your score. You won’t get a prize if you solve a question that only 10 students out of 2 lac could solve. The marks per question is the same. Since you solve the easier problems first, the chances of your committing mistakes goes down considerably. A question which you have solved but incorrectly is not wasted time and only a -1 for your score. Instead of 3 you get a -1. So such a question effectively hits you with lost time and a -4. This method reduces the no of such questions. Hence, this approach.\nF2.) DILR -> Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning\n\nIf you have tried solving the book which I had mentioned above, you would by now have a fair idea about how to make a table for solving LR problems. 5 people, 5 countries, 5 cars, 5 pets. All of us have solved such puzzles,haven’t we? You would obviously have 4 columns but which would be the first and which would be the second, etc. That determines how fast you will be able to solve the set. Oh, you thought it didn’t make a difference? It does! Sometimes you are better off soling set theory problems by a table. This is where your practise and experience comes into play. Making the proper table means half the work is done then and there. You just have to put in the values and tick mark the correct answers now.\nNow about how to attempt. When you start the section, go through the 4 LR sets.1-2 sets will be very easy. Take a couple of minutes and try to identify the easier ones. Look at the questions. Do you see any question wherein it asks how many cases are possible or questions of that sort? Such sets are to be solved at the end. Look for sets wherein directly by looking at the questions, you know that there is one unique solution. Use the answer options to further reduce your time for soling that set. Now start with such sets. First advantage of this method will be that you will feel good, because you will be done with a couple of sets in 10-12 minutes. Additionally you will be in a flow and your chances of cracking a difficult set will go up. Now compare this to the case when you start the section, and think that looking at all the questions means losing a few minutes. I am James Bond, so I will start with the first set. 10 minutes later you haven’t completed a single question and now for the remaining 50 minutes you will keep thinking, yaar 10 min faaltu mein barbaad ho gaye. Good luck solving that section and the next with such a mind-set.\nMany a time it will happen that the set you picked up, is going nowhere and yet time is passing on. For such sets, wherein you have already spent 4-5 minutes but haven’t been able to mark even a single question. Please leave that set.You might be tempted to think sirf 2 min aur, aur phir 4 questions ban jayenge. Please don’t commit that mistake. 5 minutes is the threshold in which you should have been able to mark at least 2 questions. Worst case scenario 1. If you are at 0. Please move on. You are better off solving that set later on,preferably at home!\nSame with DI sets, go through the sets, select the easier ones, and complete them. You will be left off with 2 sets. Again with 2 options, it always easy to select the easier one. This way most of the times, you will end up solving the toughest set at the end or you will probably leave it. All questions have the same marks, so isn’t it better to solve easier ones? Additionally tougher problems will also take a toll on your brain, your effectiveness for the next section might go down. Do you want that to happen?\nSometimes a set will be easy but a question in there will be extremely tough.Beware of such questions, these are put in place to derail your momentum. 5-7 minutes per set is what you should be looking at. Always look at the questions and attempt. You don’t have to attempt all questions from a set. Even 3 attempts for a set is fine. Again, you know the term that I am talking about!Keep that aside when attempting a mock.\nF3.) VA -> Verbal Ability\n\nI get tired of reading and lose interest quickly. So RCs at the end seems a bad idea. So, I start off with RCs. Again as soon as you start this section. Glance through all the RCs in a minute and check if any of them is from a subject you like. Your reading speed and comprehension will be higher in this case. Again as mentioned above, just because you read an RC, doesn’t mean you have to attempt all the questions. Even 4 out of 6 questions from an RC is good enough. Just attempting for the sake of increasing attempts is sheer stupidity. Please don’t think ki aree yaar itne marks toh already aa hi rahe hain exam mein. Dusron ko thoda mauka de deta hun -2 leke. Please don’t do that. Eliminate options and then attempt. When in doubt leave. Move on to the single questions after the RCs.\nNote -> For non-CAT mocks which you attempt online.\nFirst and foremost thing is that apart from CAT, most are pen paper based, but at home you attempt online papers for these. Take a few print outs of the OMR sheet and check how many minutes you need for marking the answers. Keep a 5 min buffer for your safety. Let’s say we talk about IIFT. It’s a 2 hour paper in real. However I need 20 minutes just for marking the bubbles. So, there is absolutely no point in attempting the online paper at home for 2 hrs. Submit the test after 100 minutes. Don’t worry if people attempt for 2 hours and your rank is low. Your score in the main exam matters, not in this one. Similarly for SNAP and XAT as well. Form a basic strategy of how you would like to attempt the paper for the 100 minutes(whatever your time is after you have checked marking in the OMR sheet). Like for Snap, I had a strategy of 5-6 minutes for gk then 16-18 minutes for verbal, then 35-40 minutes for LR. Then maths and as soon as it would be 90 minutes after the start, I would mark all the answers. Then solve and again mark in the last 5 minutes. Similarly make your strategy for IIFT, SNAP, XAT, etc. and stick to it.\nG.) How to analyse mock?\n\nThe instant you submit a mock, you will have a score in mind, itna toh banta hai. 1 sec later the page reloads and you see your score and you go, are yaar itne toh 2 section milake hi aa jane chahiye the. This is why analysing the mock is important. You knew a certain score was achievable but your score went down drastically because of silly mistakes. Analysing mocks will take care of such mistakes. Once the solutions and result for a mock are out. First of all check up all the problems which you couldn’t solve. That’s what you have to learn.\nThen look at the time taken by the topper in solving a question. Look at your time. Did you take 200 seconds whereas the topper took 30 seconds? That’s because there is a technique you don’t about. Learn that technique. Write it in your notebook where you write formulas. That was about identifying and learning things which the toppers know. You have to be one of them. Go through the mocks and find such methods. Additionally\nThen there will be a category of questions you were sure of but you somehow used your talent and got it wrong and after looking at the solution you are like aree yaar yeh koi kaise galat kar sakta hai. But as a matter of fact, you did! This will happen mostly in counting problems (Numbers). Even if you had 100 in English in 10 and 12 you will still come to know that you had been using some Grammar rule incorrectly or there is some exception you had no clue about. But, after a -4 you will remember them! You will sometimes come to know that a certain word which you have been using all your life can also be used in a totally different context. Thank You without an exclamation mark? Sarcasm! Oxymoron, alliteration, etc. Learn what these mean. Such mistakes will make sure you remember all these. Sometimes you will take the diameter as the radius and solve. Sometimes 2*3 will become 5 and sometimes 7*19 will become 114. Don’t rush through problems. The paper is set so as to give you enough time. Slow and steady wins the race.\nThen another section in the results shows the % of people who attempted a question and % of people who got it right. You are supposed to attempt the easy ones first, then the average difficulty questions. Finally attempt a few difficult ones or totally leave them out. Here you can check which questions you were supposed to attempt but didn’t. Also the questions which you were supposed to leave but being the Bond that you are, you nonetheless decided to attempt it thereby losing marks and giving others a chance to overtake you. If your family is worth billions of dollars, you could do that, but given that you are still reading this, I doubt it! So whenever you look at such questions, try to think about what was in your mind during the mock which made you do such a thing. Try not to commit the same mistake again.\nYes, I agree all this will take more than 3 hours. Who told you getting into a good B-school was easy?\nH.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?\n\nThe study material from the top 3 institutes namely Time, CL and IMS is mostly the same. I have seen and used it, so use whichever you want, it won’t make a big difference. A few new ones like Hitbullseye and test funda are also coming up. Haven’t used the material by these 2 so can’t comment. In terms of content the level of questions is higher in Time. I mean tougher questions here, so you are better prepared for CAT, but then you could also argue about why put in more effort than required. In CL, the theory and explanations for quant is way better that that in others. Theory for quant is literally non-existent in Time. IMS is good for verbal. As mentioned above, please use that book for LR and also that book for Verbal. I have not mentioned the names of the books, because if you scroll up and check you will then remember the name when you have to tell it to the shopkeeper! That LR book will help make a strong base for you and then completing the LR material from these institutes will give you practise and improve your skills further. For those who keep talking about Arun Sharma, please please please use proper material. Do you really think 1 book is good enough for your CAT preparation and others are stupid who go through all that? If you think you are smart enough and don’t need all that and 1 book is enough. Good Luck with CAT!\nMocks basically tell you where you stand when compared to the toppers in the country. Time has the most no of people attempting its Aimcats. So having that is a must. Next in line, with the maximum no of people attempting the mocks would be CL. After that you have IMS, test funda and all. Aimcats are pretty tough when compared to actual CAT but are extremely important because it gives you a true picture of where you stand and how much more effort you need to put in. CL mocks are close to the CAT level especially in terms of quant. IMS mocks are close to CAT level in verbal. I would suggest Time + CL/IMS. You can however take all the 3 if you want. Or maybe some other institute’s mock series. It’s mostly about practise.\nThe mock questions are mostly the same. It’s just the values that they keep changing every year. Same with the material. Whether you look at the material of this year or that of 5 years ago, you will realise that it’s mostly the same. So, you are better off buying old material from someone or from a secondhand book store. I have uploaded some mocks and some prep material. Here’s the link for that.\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id...\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id...\nI also found some useful material from total gadha. Here’s the link for that\nhttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...\nhttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...\nI.) GD-PI-WAT prep\n\nFrankly speaking, getting a score is easy. This is the tougher part. This requires more hard work because in here, you will be up against the best in the country. Most of the people attending the interviews will come prepared, so here your odds will be higher. So, please work hard for this. GDPI prep as such should be dealt with in a different question. So, won’t go into the details here, but just an over view of what is expected of you. If you had done the GK and current affairs part as mentioned above, you will be easily able to manage the WAT. You will also have ample of points for speaking in a GD. Similarly questions on current affairs in a PI will also be a piece of cake for you. What remains is the HR part. In here, you have to understand that you can guide the interview and you can force them to ask exactly what you have prepared. But that requires a little thinking. Tell me about yourself is a standard question which is used to initiate an interview. It is mostly followed by your strengths and weaknesses. The main thing here is that you have to try to make a story and link everything that you have done in your life till now with why you want to do an MBA. The interviewers are smart people, they have been doing this for years. They are extremely good at catching liars. So think this through well. This part of your prep needs your utmost dedication and hard work. Prepare your answers properly. It is really tough to explain how to prepare for GD-PI. You will be better off at some institute where someone can guide you individually. However, what I can still do is upload all the GDPI material that I have and share it with you. But do keep one thing in mind, this contains some files on the current affairs of 2015, so that will be of no use for you. The other stuff is pretty much relevant. Here’s the link for that.\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id...\nI hope you convert your dream college.

This post is dedicated to “Avoiding Mistakes” strategy.\nMyth & Mistake-1: Following the Herd. Choosing a help or any coaching because others are choosing it\nHumans belongs to Animal kingdom. If you have studied Biology, then this point will be easier to understand. In animal kingdom. Weak animals are always in herd but the strong one is solitary or always having small groups. Ever wondered Why??\nThe answer lies in the mentality. A strong animal judges the situation and leads its life based on its experience but a weak animal actions are based upon others. If others are doing it, then it’s wise to do it. You can choose to be a Herd follower or to make your own paths.\nNever follow the group. A leader never follows. If you will move with a group, you will always be with them. If you will create your paths, then only you can beat others. Adding following lines from Robert Frost to add a dramatic touch:\n“Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”\nMyth & Mistake-2: Focusing on absolute number of Successful Candidates rather than Percentage.\nMost of the Institutes talks about the number of success stories but are silent on how many of their students were unsuccessful. Even their Advertisements talks about total number of students getting Interview call or final admits. But the real numbers are shocking, most of the Institutes have 2-3 % students getting expected result.\nBut the magic is in numbers. Make people follow a Herd and even if 2-3% students are successful, the success numbers become substantial. The problem is that your chances of landing in the unsuccessful students group is 98%, but this data does not bother them because they know how to work upon the “Herd Mentality” of the population. Show them 2% success stories and make them follow a herd.\nMyth & Mistake-3: The Bigger the Better.\nI am referring to Class Strength. No teacher can teach a herd. If your batch size is more than 10-12 students, then you are not getting proper attention from a teacher. If the education company is claiming “Customized or Personalized” services, then the class size must be less than 10-12 students.\nMyth & Mistake-4: Going after a Brand or No.1 education company\nAll Branded books are easily available in the market at very low-cost. A student joins any help or coaching to get a personalized teaching experience. A Teacher-Student relation is analogous to a Mother-Child relation. There is nothing called “No. 1 Mother”. Every mother is No. 1 for her Kids and the reason is her personalized attention.\nRather than sitting in a large group with “No. 1”, you should aim for a personalized attention (We join any help for their teachers or their course offering).\nMyth & Mistake-5: Deciding after taking Demos\nAll Institutes stage their Demos. They are very carefully planned. The teacher is usually the teacher, who will not teach regularly. If anyone says “Book your demo” or guide you to a specific time, then it is staged. The best way is to ask them about their class timings and insist on sitting in the ongoing class. If you feel the focus is on you, then you are at the wrong place.\nTry to identify honest institutes. Honesty should be a very important deciding factor.\nMyth & Mistake-6: Choosing Institute which makes “Toppers” or just focuses on “Past Records”\nNever choose any institute if its marketing is focused on this fundamental. Keep your basics simple. Think what you want from it and focus on its delivery. You are there for education, not to hear its past stories.\nInstitutes focus on this factor to take your attention away from their product. Your focus should only be on their product, their teachers, their teaching methodologies, their course structures, etc.\nMyth & Mistake-7: Jo Dikhta hai, Wo (Nahi) Bikta hai\nA good product needs no marketing. Weak products need marketing. Whenever you see lots of marketing effort, Google ads, ATL or BTL, it proves that the product is weak. Strong product does not need for all these advertisements. In the marketing world, out of 4Ps, the product is supreme. Focus on “Product”.\nMyth & Mistake-8: Marketing Gimmick-CAT/GMAT Toppers as Teachers\nThis is the most commonly used marketing tool, which has a flawed assumption. Now I am talking more of “Critical Reasoning” language. The flawed assumption is “All Toppers are good Teachers”. Teaching needs a very different skill set. The teaching is to impart knowledge; all toppers cannot be good teachers and all good teachers cannot be toppers.\nMyth & Mistake-9: Institutes offering Patented Techniques or “Tips & Tricks”\nAll tests require “Hard Work”. If someone can patent “Hard-work”, then this “Gimmick” should be accepted. “Tips & Tricks” are developed with your hard-work. Shortcuts should be evolved and should never be learnt from someone else. Particularly for CAT/GMAT, which is more of an IQ test, “Techniques, Tips & Tricks” should be evolved.\nMyth & Mistake-10: CAT/GMAT will take me to Harvard\nThis point is more applicable to business schools taking GMAT as a screening tool.\nThe student’s full profile will work. The CAT/GMAT is a one small part of the profile. Look at all business schools as a family, no family will allow you to be their part till the time they see their values or virtues in you. Every Business school has a distinct positioning and your profile should be positioned in the same way. Profile building is the main work and every person should concentrate on.\nMyth & Mistake-11: Adopting Toppers Strategies\nHear everyone, but adopt none. Every person develops his own ways depending upon his Strengths & Weaknesses or as per his conditions. Good for someone may not be good for you. Hear everyone, but adopt only wisely.\nMyth & Mistake-12: Practice-More the merrier\nPractice Better, Not More. The practice should have a direction, running in circles will not help. Do Tests and review. Keep error Logs and keep on practicing. Practice wisely, so that every time you move, you should learn from your past mistakes. Do not overdo the tests.\nMyth & Mistake-13: Teachers will make me a Topper\nTeachers show us directions. Unless you practice the topics taught in the class, it will not work. I saw many students thinking that if they spend more time in classes, it will help.\nMyth & Mistake-14: All tests just needs lot of studying, no need to focus on health\nHealthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. I see many students not focusing on their health during exams. Many of the studious people have unhealthy bodies. You need to balance life with at least 7-8 hours’ sleep.\nMyth & Mistake-15: I do not need any peer group\nYou learn more from peers than the teachers. The most important factor will be jealousy. Competition in the group brings the best out of you. I was very fortunate that all others in my group were good. They have already scored more than 700 in prep tests. Every test was like a world war where every one of us wanted to beat everyone else in the group.\nMyth & Mistake-16: I will study and practice from lot of free materials on net\nBeware of free materials. There is no free lunch. Some free materials are good, but most of it is crap. The real test is different from the Free tests you see on the net. You will be caught off-guard if you are preparing from the net material.\nMyth & Mistake-17: Beware from 30-day toppers, 15-day toppers\nThis is the most common way of advertisement. Become a topper in 30 days or 15 days. It’s hilarious. This is a perfect example of fraud marketing. The CAT/GMAT is an IQ test. Only Asterix magic potion can do it and nothing else.\nMyth & Mistake-18: You can deceive GMAT Computer Adaptive Algorithm\nPlease do not try. GMAC has evolved a test which cannot be deceived. Every question can carry you “Up” and throw you “Down”. Each question is important and has the same value as others do.\nOne more myth is when a student believes that difficult questions carry more marks. And easy questions weightage is low. Do not read too much into any strategy. Work hard and it will show.\nOne more mistake is trying to gauge your performance by counting correct questions out of total. This is the reason why the GMAC computer algorithm is difficult to copy.\nIf you see easy questions, you are not doomed. It does not necessarily mean that your test is not going well.\nMyth & Mistake-19: Quantitative is important, Engineers have an advantage\nEngineers do not have any advantage in this test. Rather, they are at a disadvantage because their strength (Quant.) does not have substantial weightage. I have seen many students crossing 700 with 40 in quant and Q40 can be achieved by more than 80% of the test givers.\nMyth & Mistake-20: I am good in English, verbal will be kids play\nVerbal is not English, verbal is all about IQ. The only portion of the grammar it touches is SC. But the way CAT/GMAT tests your grammar is more based on IQ rather than grammar rules. SC is more about identifying the wrong choices rather than the correct one. It depends upon how easily you can see 2-3 splits and apply logic to find the correct answer.\nIn CAT/GMAT, there is no perfect answer, you must mark the “Most” correct answer. There might not be any perfect answer in the five choices.\nYour choices should be based on your experience and how a help will help you cover your shortcomings. I found EduShastra customized approach much better than others. I also found their teachers dedicated to their students.']"

I already had a work experience of 2.5 years and I realized that this year was my do or die situation. Because, by the time I again appear for the CAT next year, I would already be having a work experience of 4 years which would not provide me the edge anymore. So according to me, this was my first and last shot.\nNow as you know, when you have your back up against the wall, you become desperate and you do anything. Same was the case with me. I was working and my job profile demanded full attention for 10-11 hours. That left me only with 2-3 hours to study. So I left all the beauties of life and chose a life of a workaholic nerd. I used to return home a 10 pm from office. Within one hour, I hurriedly changed, swallowed food and went to bed by 11-11:30 p.m. I still remember those days when I used to crave for having dinner with my family but had to eat early as I need to wake up early the next day and start preparing for CAT. I woke up around 7 a.m. the next day and started solving problems from all the books and materials that I had gathered. By 10 a.m., I used to wrap up everything and leave for office.\nIf you think I was done for the day, You are deeply mistaken!! I took the full advantage of commuting for 1-1.5 hours (one way). I had installed various apps and I solved the VARC section while going to the office. Luckily, that section did not require pen-paper, so it was easier for me to have a look at that section while travelling to office. While returning from office, I used to go through the daily news so that it would help me in the WAT/PI process.\nI didn’t leave a single opportunity to study in the office as well. When my team members were busy taking a puff or gossiping over lunch, I used to have my lunch at desk, pouring over online Quant problems.\nThe weekends were even more difficult. While most of my friends and colleagues enjoyed, went on dates and watched movies, I used to either attend coaching classes or lock myself in the room taking mocks. I took 2-3 mocks every weekend and I spent the rest of my week analyzing the mocks. For an entire one year, I seldom went out with friends. Yes, for a few people and occasions I do made an exception, but like I said, they were literally few.\nLuckily, all these paid off and by god’s grace, I am today a member of the IIM family. Being a working professional, without the dedication that I showed, I would not have been able to reach an IIM today. So my advice to you would be: work hard for just a year. You would be able to reap the benefits for the rest of your life. Believe me, you would not want to miss out on being a part of the IIM family and the huge network of the eminent B-schools. A few movies on the weekends are nothing in front of what the other side of the table has to offer to you. Trust me, if you show dedication, you would not regret it. Ever.\nHope this helps.\nAll the best!', ""I took CAT twice.\nThe first attempt was during my Engineering last year.\nI was always good at Quantitative Aptitude, and that stayed my strength since the start. I have blogs on logic puzzles, and knowing those tricks helped me a lot in cracking Logical reasoning, Quantitative Aptitude and Data Interpretation.\nResult of my first CAT attempt: 99.32 percentile (99.97 in Quant and ~70 in verbal)\nMy Quant score was so high that it helped me sail above 99 even after having only 70 percentile in verbal.\nThat was not the lowest point of my CAT journey. The lowest point came when I ended up missing admission in FMS that year by 0.19 composite score out of 100 (Yes. This score is calculated after adding CAT score, extempore and Interview marks). It was just like- had they given me 0.19 marks more in an interview, I would have gotten the admission.\nThis is just the former part of how I dedicated myself to CAT.\nThe day this FMS rejection came (after waitlist movement), I was totally down. (May 2014)\nI am from Ahmedabad, and IIM Ahmedabad is 3.5 km away from my home. The institute being inside the city, at many times, I used to pass from the bridge which is in parallel to the campus. That was how I had started seeing that dream while I was in engineering. To get into this college and study in this divine campus.\nSo the first thing I did was to change my Desktop wallpaper to a WordArt which said: IIMA, I am coming.\nI sat alone and made myself accept that I was struggling very bad at verbal aptitude. Being from vernacular medium can’t be an excuse for not scoring good marks in this section.\nAfter sitting alone in my room for several hours, I was ready with a strong daily routine.\nWake up at 5 AM (Mom used to wake me up, alarm systems weren’t effective to my ears)\nStart the day with 4 Reading comprehension. This lasted for around 1.5 hour. (I literally hated this part. I would be lying if I said that I never cried doing those comprehension).\nEnding those 1.5 hours was an achievement for me. So I would treat myself with 2 hours of Quantitative Aptitude or Data Interpretation.\nThen, after a break of an hour, I will take one mock CAT.\nThen, after taking a lunch break, I will sit again with the same mock and analyze for next 2–2.5 hours on where I was slow/wrong/stupid/naive. I’ll note down the steps to take care during next mocks.\nThen, one hour of nap- which I will wake up being sad as it was again the time to do verbal aptitude preparation. 1.5 hours of Grammar, Parajumbles, Critical reasoning and sentence correction practice.\nThen, again 1 hour of Reading comprehension.\nThis is when my body will start hating my mind, and create fake signals of legs/back/head aching.\nSo, I will take another break till dinner and again work on Quant/DI/LR till 11 PM. This is when I will sleep.\nThis was how my day looked like during those days.\nI hadn’t seen any movies during that time.\nI had lost contacts to all my friends except a few close ones who had to feel the pain of keeping me out of stress.\nI had quit my job on the second day (Sept 2014. Yes, I was placed during campus recruitment. I had moved to Pune from Ahmedabad and returned on the third day.) when I saw that I wouldn’t be able to fulfill my dream of getting into IIMA.\nI had faced the shouts and scoldings of my relatives who told me that leaving a job for an exam of which the result is uncertain- was a totally stupid move. In fact, one of this scolding happened in a public gathering which I had to attend. It was embarrassing to get scolded in front of all.\nAll this was happening, but the only thing which kept me going was that my parents believed in me. Many people criticized me for taking stupid decisions, but my parents always stayed positive about me, and boosted me saying I will achieve what I had decided to.\nAs a result, I did achieve it all.\nI took four MBA entrance exams. The results were:\nCAT: 99.89 Percentile\nSNAP: 99.94 Percentile\nIIFT: 99.96 Percentile\nXAT: 99.74 Percentile (Didn’t clear Decision making sectional cutoff though)\nAnd, eventually,\nI got into IIM Ahmedabad. It was a dream which I preserved and believed in- for years. At times, I had stopped believing in myself, but with the help of my parents and those close friends, I succeeded.\nTo all the aspirants who are walking through the journey of their own- don’t lose hope. Stay positive and focused. The view from the top is totally worthy of all these sleepless nights that you are spending working hard for the exam.\n-Arjuna@War\n(Just in case you want to know how my IIMA interview went- you can read here: Parth Shah's answer to What is an IIM interview like?)\nThose who want to know my blog on Logic puzzles: .Logic Puzzles for Logic Lovers\nI am getting many inquiries related to exam and I have written quite a few answers on these topics. I compiled a list of links to all CAT/MBA related answers. You can find those here: Links to all my CAT/MBA related posts by Parth Shah )\nThis surely doesn’t mean you can’t reach out to me.

Once an interest create in these topics they will not bore you again. Here i will help you to make it interesting.\nYou already mention that topics of CAT entrance exam are not interesting. It means you have gone through it but still i mention them here. For making little bit interesting we can divide all three section of CAT into 5 areas-\nQuantitative Aptitude (QA)\nData Interpretation (DI)\nLogical Reasoning (LR)\nReading Comprehension (RC)\nVerbal Ability (VA)\nGo through below given link where you will get topic wise syllabus of each area- CAT Syllabus 2018 - Complete Details of Topics required for CAT Exam\nAgain you go through the syllabus and hopefully you feel it boring again.

May be you are using conventional way of study.\nIf the reason-1 is true than go through the link- How is life after IIM? Answers of this question will create interest in study and topics will no longer boring. If it creates interest than start focusing on your dream IIM.\nIf you are studying through books and any other documents. After 20–30 mins you get bored and left the books. If the case is like this than start studying through video lectures because human can understand better through video. After understand the topic, solve some problem on that particular topic. These questions will help you to understand the base of that particular topic.\nYou can find many videos on a particular topic on YouTube but i suggest you to don’t relay on YouTube video. YouTube is a total distraction. Once you open a video and YouTube suggest many other video like funny video, pranks, movie video etc. This type of material will definitely distract human mind as well as it’s very hard to select better video in between more videos on a single topic.\nOnline course is much better option.

Those are pretty interesting.\nFor VA, you can start by studying the book Word Power made easy by Norman Lewis to improve your vocabulary. The author has tried and succeeded in keeping the book interesting while making the learning of various words and their roots possible.\nOther than this you can follow one of the CAT Study Plan that is there here.\nNow, to make it interesting you can use the technique positive reinforcement like if you follow the plan for a week you treat yourself with a Pizza or go out for the movies. Anything that works for you.\nYou have to be true to yourself for this.\nGood luck.', ""I use to hate CAT English. In my first CAT attempt in 2007 (without any prep), I scored well in QA and DI/LR (99+) but not good in VA(70+). The RCs in CAT 2006 and 2007 were scary to read leave alone solving. I knew that if I want to do well in CAT then I have to overcome this feeling. To score well in VA, I have to start loving the language. Following is the story of my love affair with Comprehension.\nComprehension and I were acquaintance since 1995 when I learned alphabets but I think I never understood her till 2008. But CAT 2007 result made me realize that I have to woo her to like me.\nIt is not as if I have not tried before. When I gifted here red roses, teddy bears etc. (started reading The Hindu editorial) she said we barely know each other and it is too early. She threw everything over my head (could not understand The Hindu editorial thing). But I still persisted for 15 days but there was not much progress in the relationship. Hence my effort to read The Hindu editorial and woo Comprehension did not even last a month. I think I tried The Hindu/ToI editorial thing at least 5–6 times but every time the results were similar with very little improvement in camaraderie between us. My efforts were sincere but somehow it was not working out.\nI had to make a different plan, a full proof plan. A plan which I don’t have to abandon after just 15 days but a plan which can make it a lifetime relationship.\nI realized Comprehension is not interested in those heavy duty gifts (Editorials n all classic novels) in the beginning. She loves to spend time with just knowing each other. In the beginning, we begin talking about our hobbies (I read sports novels/biographies, I like sports). Later, we moved to my likes and dislikes (I liked history and geography so read books on history, religion and geography). Hours went by, days went by, months went by, I was always with her (sometimes on phone, sometimes through papers) whenever I am home. Our love was blossoming.\nAfter 3 months, I thought I should take to another level. I gathered courage and picked a classic novel Catch 22 from a bookstore. Before beginning, I was wondering whether it will have the same fate as those Hindu editorials or is it a new beginning.\nI planned a weekend trip with her. Friday evening, I picked her at 7 pm. It was a slow start. It was as if you are writing 10 lines long message and getting a two-liner response. I was enjoying it but I felt something is missing. So, we said goodnight to each other and decided to meet early in the morning.\nI got before sunrise and made a coffee and was ready for the second round of the weekend date. It was similar to the last night, was going slow. The whole Saturday went in the same fashion and a cold day for me and my feelings. I could read only 100 pages till now. The old trauma of mistreatment with The Hindu editorials was coming to mind. But I thought that Sunday could be my day.\nThe next morning, it continued. The story had too many characters. I was barely able to keep all of them in my mind. By evening, I was tired, tired of trying it for 2 consecutive days, tired of trying to fall in love with English, it was painful. Left her alone in my room and went out with friends to eat out. Came back at 10 pm. I saw her, went close to her and now I could smell the wood pulp which I loved. I decided I should give myself one more chance.\nIn the next one hour, with things started to pick the pace. I understood the plot. I realized what was missing, it was satirical novel. Oh, how silly. I finished the remaining 300 pages by 5 am. I made coffee and it tasted better this time. The feeling was different, I don’t how to explain it. I had to go to the office but I did not want to sleep. In fact, I was not feeling sleepy. I knew I am in love.\nI knew now I can crack any comprehension. VA was a piece of cake thereafter :)\nIf you hate any subject then you have to first give some time to understand it. Don’t be harsh on yourself, be slow but be consistent. In the beginning, attempt only topics which you like. If you don't like any topic then begin with topics you are familiar with. Love the subjects, you will definitely succeed :)\nAll the best\nKamlesh Chauhan\nLog into Facebook | Facebook\nBFactory Delhi"", ""Give up the thoughts that you unlike CAT topics. The more you unlike more they will be difficult. You are giving negative energy to yourself.\nTell yourself that you can do it and you will challenge yourself to prove your abilities. CAT is all about your own performance. Don't compete with anyone, just try to better your own scores.\nPick up a book you would like to read, it doesn't have to be a classic or a heavy topic. Read what interests you.\nQuant you must focus on the easier part and ace the sums of level 1 difficulty. Don't fret if you can't solve higher levels. CAT is about a good selection of questions. If you solve easy questions with a good accuracy you will get a high percentile.\nGo to the examination centre with confidence and an open mind. Don't have a fixed mindset of solving certain number of questions or type of questions. See the paper and decide. Difficult for you can be difficult for all. Don't get rattled.\nEat nutritious food and sleep well in the last week.\nJust keep calm.\nAll the best!""]"
Is preparing for the CAT enough for admission?,11 Answers,['CAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nIs preparing for the CAT enough for admission?'],"['No.\nWe Indian students are a terribly hardworking breed. Once put our minds to anything, it doesn’t stand a chance. Look at the ever increasing scores in all exams across the world. All conquered. So when someone starts to feel bugged by their engineering coursework(majority aspirants) and having a knack for cracking exams, they get to know about CAT. Another MCQ based paper that delights the best of us given its nature and the level it is tested on. True feline.\nYou enroll, prepare, appear, ace and end up with a number. That number is just to get a call. It does not even appear in the interview application form(so the panel does not know if you are a 100%iler or a 98-only in ABC). Also, you can’t write it in your CV once inside IIM.\nWhat remains? Interview, Written Test(called WAT/AWT) and maybe GD. So CAT isn’t the actual D-Day, your interview day is.\nPeople say that there is some weightage for CAT as well in the final selection. It’s usually 30%. Without even normalising(as some institutes might do and which you must know reduces the difference of scores further), let’s just say they divide your CAT score by 10. So if you got 220/300 in CAT, you get 22/30 in final composite score. Makes sense?\nLook at the other side of the picture now.\n220 was 99.98%ile this year.\n100% was 230+\n99% was ~172\n99.6% was ~185(close to AC cutoffs)\nNow calculate their weightage individually.\n100%ile→23+/30(Mind you, only 20 people across the country, highest being 27.5)\n99.98%ile→22/30\n99.6%ile→18.5/30\n99%ile→17.2/30\nSee what the difference between a 100 and a 99(a difference of 2000 ranks btw) amounts to in the final score? Barely 6 marks. Reduces to 4 if you are 99.95.\nPoint being-CAT does not guarantee anything. In the anonymous answer below, I personally know many people in that list being one myself.\nI was curious as to why such high CAT score couldn’t fetch a IIM-B call. Here’s what the RTI says.\nNote the weightages for each component:\nCAT-40, X-20, XII-10, UG-20, Workex-8, Diversity-2\nMy scores:\nX-94.43(661/700)[ICSE], XII-93.6(468/500)[ISC], UG-70.4%, CAT-99.98(219.81/300), Workex-0\nSo it’s not that you need to have “poor” acads to not even get a call. I was the district topper in 10/12 and an average(not poor) lad in UG. But no call still. Learn this-they seek impeccable, not good. Outliers do exist though.\nThis answer is absolutely not intended to demotivate anyone. I knew about these facts from the start and yet gave it a shot. But many people remain oblivious of the reality. It’s better to know the consequences before building castles in your mind. Some motivation? For same number of people getting rejected, there are a few getting selected as well. But then there are those courageous souls who, even after getting 99.9+ retake CAT multiple times to get in just ABC(in a few cases, just A). So it all depends on your risk taking ability. Just keep a fair idea of where you might land up. I for one always knew about no B call. And was comfortable joining any of ABCLKI(though later mind started to think about retaking CAT). But then realised that having made through once doesn’t mean I could get a call always(tremendous luck needed). So accepted my place in the normal distribution curve.\nGoodluck!', 'The answer to this question is no. The most important thing to get an admission in a B-school is how much do you score in CAT, and not how much did you prepare.\nEven if you crack the CAT, your admission would depend a lot upon the college which you seek an admission into.\nFor a lot if colleges, yes, you can get an admission as soon as you have crossed a particular percentile score in CAT (assuming that you have applied/will apply for that institute) and have higher percentile than the cut-off for the institute for that year.\nFor most (almost all) of the tier-1 B-schools in India, the answer to, if you will get an admission even if you have a high CAT percentile, is “NO” . In fact, cracking the CAT is just half the journey covered.\nMost of the top B-schools, give individuals calls for the further rounds based on their past academic scores, work-experience and CAT score (gender and academic diversity play a role in getting calls too). Once one has received a call, s/he has to undergo one or more of the following process rounds:\nWAT (Written Ability Test),\nGD ( Group Discussions), and\nPersonal Interview\nThe weightage allotted to these rounds for most of the top B-schools is very high. For some institutes it is as high as the CAT score and in some cases even more than the CAT score. Hence, performing equally well in all of these rounds is as important as performing well in the CAT. A final composite score is then calculated separately for every individual and based on the occupancy of the college for that year, final admission are given.\nTo learn more about the WAT, GD and PI rounds conducted across institutes and how to excel at them, I recommend you to watch the video linked.\nCAT WAT, GD, PI video.\nHope this helps.\nAll the best.', ""100%iler GEM - Rejected from ABC\n99.98%iler GEM- Rejected from AC. No call from B.\n99.78 G-NE-M- Rejected from C. No call from B.\n99.76 GEM- Rejected from C no AB call\n99.92 G-NE-M - rejected from AC. No B call..\n99.90 G-NE-M- Rejected from C.

You'll be lucky to get a call.\nI'm one of the GEMs in the list above.\nAim for XAT/GMAT/MDI or max FMS via CAT if your acads are bad.\nI can only imagine how the others in the list must be feeling right now. It hurts because CAT exam have so many tuitions and mock series and what not crap. It's so overhyped that people forget that it's just a filtering criteria(you're just a number on the excel sheet bro) and nobody cares once you get a call(apart from XLRI MDI FMS). I and the others might not have been as good as we could've been,but I'm cent percent sure we didn't do that bad to be waitlisted in 200s or be direct rejects.\nIt's just effort down the drain. I'm not trying to be a spoilsport but just giving you the truth- truth that nobody told me. Truth that these so called experts with 20+ years of experience in the industry don't tell you because they know if they tell you that you have a slim chance of a call even with 99.8+ you'll never join since it'll become too much of a gamble. Greed at its very best. Seriously you guys,the hell?\nThe argument that “if you know that you can't get a call with a high percentile will you stop studying? No right?” Is the shittiest argument I've ever heard. 99.8+ requires efforts and thorough mock analyses,at least for regular people. I'm not one of those brilliant people who study 1 hour a day for 2 months and crack CAT. So yes, I for one probably wouldn't have if I knew I needed 99.95 for an Ahmedabad call and that even a 100 wouldn't have gotten me a Bangalore call. I would've used my energy and time somewhere else productively.\nTL;DR NO.\nI wish I could see recordings of converts and rejects and compare. Feel like absolute crap.\nRant over.\nPS: Funny story- 93%ile SC-E-M - Converted ABC. Go figure."", 'No, preparing alone for CAT is not enough to get an admission and the reasons could be as mentioned below :\nStrong in Academics (Getting 99 percentile) but weak in personality development like lack of good effective communication skills (Includes Writing + Speaking Skills) might lead to student not doing well at all in WAT and PI.\nEach and every IIMs are autonomous institutions. They have their own criteria to select. So no one can question them when it comes to their credibility during the selection process.\nOverconfidence. Don’t be overconfident if you get 99 percentile in CAT. Please don’t forget that you have WAT and PI. Prepare well and give your best.\nBe careful at the time of personal interviews. Kindly respect and be very humble with the interviewers (IIM Professors). Don’t act way too smart and No Heropanti Please.\nOver smart. There might be many others like you who get selected.

My rescue is affectionate/cuddly but nurses on her thigh whenever I pet her, an indication that she was weaned too early. I love them both.

How was the CAT 2018?,45 Answers,['Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExams and Tests\nHow was the CAT 2018?'],"['Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.\nOriginal Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.\nBut the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.\nQuant was relentless\nThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar to\nAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?\nWherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.\nFirst principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.\nVARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easier\nVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.\nDILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.\nPercentile Ranges - Expected\nKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following ranges\nVARC - similar to CAT 2017\n99.5th percentile plus - 73+\n99th percentile – 66\n97th percentile – 60\n94th percentile – 54\n90th percentile – 50\n80th percentile – 40\nDILR - Also similar to CAT 2017\n99.5th percentile plus - 52+\n99th percentile – 42\n97th percentile – 37\n94th percentile – 30\n90th percentile – 24\n80th percentile – 20\nQuant - a step above what was seen in CAT 2017\n99.5th percentile plus - 54+\n99th percentile – 43\n97th percentile – 38\n94th percentile – 35\n90th percentile – 29\n80th percentile – 23\nOverall for CAT 2018\n99.5th percentile plus - 160+\n99th percentile – 140\n97th percentile – 127\n94th percentile – 115\n90th percentile – 100\n80th percentile – 75\nOnce again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.\nBest wishes for the results, folks.', 'Since the paper and the official answers are out, let me start with my scores in CAT18 (Slot 2)\nVerbal - 66\nDILR - 78\nMaths - 86\nTotal - 230\nIf I get a 100%ile it will be the 5th time in CAT.\nAbout myself:\nI am a Faculty who trains students fot Maths and DILR section.\nI have taken CAT number of times and my past performance is as follows\n100%ile (4 times) - 2007, 2009, 2016, 2017\n99.99%ile - 2015\n99.98%ile - 2008, 2011, 2014\nI usually write the exam to learn something, and there is a lot of learning from every CAT exam I write. The idea of this post is to list down my learnings.\nMy last two years score cards are as follows\nBefore going to the paper, the review of the first slot was that Verbal was simple, DILR was also relatively easy as compared to last year. Maths was really tough.\nBut over the years I have realised that whatever you listen to - ensure that you go with the flow of the paper and avoid predicting the paper.\nVerbal:\nHow I wrote the paper?\nWhen I started the paper, the language for the initial RCs was simple, but questions were tricky. Wasted a lot of time on the initial few questions. Then I realised my teaching to the studens, not to waste time on questions. Just mark what you feel is the answer after eliminating the options and move ahead. Though I followed the process still it did take time. Just finished the paper in time with a little haste in the last para jumbles. In the previous attempts I usually have 5 to 10 minutes in the end after I have gone through all the questions.\nPerformance:\n66 score in this paper looked fine. I am anyways not strong in Verbal. Did not have a good feeling with regards to Verbal. But considering that I have scored 99.9x%ile in verbal section in CAT15 and CAT16, I believe could have scored better.\nLearnings from the paper:\nDid a mistake of overthinking in the initial part of the paper. This ensured that I had to hurry in the parajumbles, which resulted in 3 out of the 4 parajumbles going wrong.\nI have realised over the years that when I read regularly before the exam I score better in Verbal. Last year and this year I have not been reading regularly. That is clearly reflected in lower scores in Verbal.\nDILR:\nHow I wrote the paper?\nI have scored 100%ile in the last 2 attempts in this section. Last year had attempted 8 sets whcih was a difficult section. Review was that this year the paper was easy. So was confident of solving 8 sets. First set was not so simple. took some time, but after some effort was able to complete the set. Second set had a lot of calculations. I built the complete framework on the paper. Could answer one question. But for solving others I had to do a lot of calculations. Was feeling lazy and I completely forgot about calculator. So skipped it and went to the next set. Now I had 2 minds if I could really solve all sets. So decided to pick easy sets and solve. Glanced through all sets and started picking up sets that I felt could have been done in short span of time. Was able to solve 5 more sets and with around 10 mins left I had 1 more set to go through and the 2nd set whcih I was not able to solve. I went to the 2nd set and was able to solve it. That left little time for the last set. Went through the set and solved 3 questions based on my understanding of the set.\nPerformance:\n78 is one of the highest score in this section this year. So should be able to get a 100%ile in this section third year in a row. I had total 31 out of 32 questions attempted with 4 answers wrong. 1 was in the last set which I did not solve properly. 1 where I solved it correct and marked it wrong. 2 questions from a single set where I was confident about the answer, but did some silly mistake. Overall did feel happy after the section as I was able to keep my head.\nLearnings:\nDont go purely based on prediction. Heard a lot of student panicked in DILR in 2nd slot as they had expected a relatively easy paper after the feedback from the first slot but turned out to be not so easy.\nWas prudent enough to leave 2nd set at that moment. Important to leave questions that are difficult as fast as possible to spend time on easy sets.\nMaths:\nHow I wrote the paper?\nMy previous year attempt in this section was that I had solved all questions but had 3 silly mistakes which resulted in score of around 90. The review was that the paper was much tougher than last year. So back of my mind I was prepared for solving lesser number of questions. But decided to solve the paper as it comes. I was able to solve the initial questions, but realised that I was taking too much time cross checking the answers as I heard the paper was tough. I realised that was a mistake. So stopped cross checking the answers and went full fledged with solving the paper as fast as possible. I did not face any hiccup in the paper. Only 1 question I left in between as I thought it will take extra time. Finished all the questions with 8 minutes to spare. Came back to that 1 question ans solved it. So with 6 minutes to spare I solved the entire paper.\nPerformance\n86 is a decent score, but could have done better. 34 attempts with 4 wrong. 2 questions I solved it correctly but marked the wrong answer. For 2 questions I used the correct method but did some silly mistake.\nLearnings:\nDon’t try to predict the paper. Go with the flow of the paper.\nIt is easy to solve a CAT paper without using Formulae or Equations.\nTips for preparation for CAT\nFor Verbal reading is the key to imporve. Read what you like and enjoy reading. Over a period of time you can read from diverse areas.\nFor DILR what is important is to build your ability in logic. Don’t only focus on CAT books but look at solving puzzles from different sources. Learning the right approach to solve DILR questions could boost your scores.\nI believe this is the area where a lot of students prepare incorrectly and hence are not able to do well in the exam. CAT exam does not test you on pure mathematics, but on how can you think logically. I have put up solution on youtube for CAT17 questions where I solved all questions with as far as possible not using exotic equations or formulae.I will do that for CAT18 too. These methods are quite simple and I have quite a few non engineers apart from engineers who perform really well in the exam using these methods. Expecting a few 99.8+%iles from my students.', 'Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam Analysis\nThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines.\n 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section.\n 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well.\n 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years\n 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.\nCAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension\nQuestion Structure\n Reading Comprehension: 24 questions\n 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)\n Parajumbles: 4 questions\n Odd one out: 3 questions\n Summary: 3 questions\nAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions.\n Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.\nSo, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.\nSummary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.\nCAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation\nQuestion Structure\n There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.\nA total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.\nAs far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced.\n In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section.\n In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016.\n In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017.\n If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.\nSummary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.\nCAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative Aptitude\nQuestion Structure\n Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it.\n Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions.\n There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).\nA total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.\nSummary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.\nExpected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 Exam\nTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam\n Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions\n Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions\n Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questions\nFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam\n To get 90%ile 35-37 questions\n To get 95%ile 42-44 questions\n To get 98%ile 48-50 questions\n To get 99%ile 53-55 questions\nWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping', 'CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!\n25th November:\nThis was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.\nSection 1: VARC\nVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 percentile in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.\nSection 2: DILR\nThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.\nSection 3: QA\nThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.\nI went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.\n30th November:\nIIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various keys in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.\n7th December:\nIIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!']"

Hence, you should know there are many like us. As a caveat, the following is very specific to me. I put it all out there to hopefully benefit someone, who can identify with me.\nI realized I had a problem focusing and concentrating. Procrastination got me down to the wire. Then laser focus and concentration kicked in. It took the pressure of an exam being imminent to put me into overdrive. I pulled all nighters all the time. I was lost and stuck. Eventually , I decided to get professional help. I was prescribed Adderall, for ADD. ( attention deficit disorder ) . I continued to see this Doctor . Subsequently, I was diagnosed as suffering from clinical depression.\nIt became clear that the lack of motivation was caused by depression, not laziness. The depression prevented me from thinking clearly and from having the energy to help myself. The ADD just exacerbated the entire painful predicament.\nAs said above, this is very specific to me and may not apply to you. However, I do highly recommend in general you see a Doctor for a complete physical. I had a complete , extremely thorough blood test. It was discovered I was EXTREMELY deficient in Vitamin D , which has many significant negative effects. Also, Vitamin D is one that is easy to become deficit in. Additional, the physical and bold test revealed a few other problems which were addressed.\nLearn more about yourself. Maybe the difficulties and hurdles because you know you are on the wrong course. Family pressures, peer pressure, societal pressure may be forcing you to be blinded and have tunnel vision. You have sources all around you can tap into to help you navigate this part of your life. Trusted friends, trusted family members, trusted professors, trusted professionals, reputable vocational testers and advisors. A trite but maybe applicable, think outside the box, pursue anything you had thoughts of doing at anytime in your life, even when you were very young. When I did that I realized I wanted to be an investigative journalist. I am on a different career path which I like, However, I incorporated the aforementioned into my life .\nIn my opinion, there are no quick fixes, nor sometimes not a total cure. Ongoing vigilance, doing the right things, listening to others who are there to help you, dedication, and hard work are necessary .\nI sincerely hope the foregoing helps you, I wish you the very best. Please note, I made it through, so will you.\nPhilip', 'Start with one small step. For example, do a small walk today. And do one tomorrow. It doesn’t need to be long, but the important thing is that you make it…. every day, come rain and shine. No excuses.\nStart exercising. Even half an hour would do - there are many exercise videos on internet, so you have your own pick of them, so you can choose one that you like, but be mindful not to begin with the hardest one from the onset. That just leads to failure and depression. My personal pick is Hip Hop Abs, because I love to dance. Once again, half an hour per day.\nClean out your living space. You could be surprised just how much cleaning out the junk can motivate you to make additional changes in your life. In addition, you will find things you need quicker, so that’s a bonus!\nLook at what you eat and change it, if necessary. Small steps here, too. So, more home-cooked meals - cooking for yourself can be fun, because it’s like having mini-experiments - and there are many recipes on the net. So, vegetables, meat and some carbs on the side along with avoiding fast food and sweets.\nDrink water. This is one of the simplest things, but you wouldn’t believe just how much it can help you. If you drink alcoholic beverages or sweet beverages, cut them out, because they slow down your mind and make you fat. Switch to water or unsweetened tea. Coffee is also an option.\nTake some of your time to help others, for example, volunteering to help teenagers with the subjects they have trouble with, or helping in pet shelter. Or become a volunteer. Social interactions matter, and it gives you wider perspective of the world. Choose one and try it. I don’t promise it will be easy, but it is worth it.\nHave a good look at what you want to do. What are you dreams, end goals. It’s not an end of the world if you failed, because you can begin anew. Yes, it will be hard, but if you are serious about it, you won’t accept excuses - only results. Find people to support you, and most importantly, hold you accountable.\nGive you permission to let go of your previous ‘failures’. Learn to forgive yourself. That blame game is the worst thing you could’ve done to yourself. You’ve failed one, and it’s in your mind even now, thousand times later. You think you won’t succeed in anything, ever, because you haven’t gone on to MBA. But I assure you, this is not the case. Having MBA is cool, but what is even more cool, is that you are human, kind, empathetic, honest. Your dreams can just as easily be realized without MBA degree, if you really want them to be realized as such. Sometimes, MBA doesn’t fit in our dreams, because there is no real MBA for dreams, for being a rock star or writer or fashion designer or whatever you want to be. Trust yourself to be successful even without degree, and if you still aim for MBA, then trust yourself to achieve it.\nAsk for help. It’s alright to be one who doesn’t know, who is confused. No person knows everything. If you are stuck, ask for help.\nEducate yourself. Knowledge is the one thing that matters when going through life. Educate yourself in finances - how to make a budget for your living, how to make savings, how to ask for a raise… Educate yourself in things that interest you. Try them out. Just for the kicks of it. Learn something new, maybe languages or how to knit or how to play an instrument, whatever you want.\nGo out of your comfort zone. Travel somewhere, even if it’s just one day trip. You will find world different, and you will have to take care of yourself to get to destination and back.. but it will be fun!\nAs for job… Read through the free material of Ramit Sethi’s. Learn to write a good CV. Learn to present yourself, and learn to negotiate. Yes, this is not taught in school, so you will have to learn it by yourself. You will make mistakes, there will be rejections, but if your persist and improve on yourself, then yes, you can get a job. Don’t settle for less - settle for what you actually want to do and do everything to get it.\nRead books. Sounds strange, but it can help you. Go to library, browse, see what book grabs your interest, and read it. Books are miniature worlds that can give you much, if you only take time and give them a shot.\nTake some time off. To relax. I am not asking you to do all of the suggestions in one go - but give them a shot to work them constantly. Progress may be small at the beginning, but it will be noticeable, the longer you are making the strides. It will take time to trust yourself because you are still blaming yourself for not getting that MBA. But it’s not end of the world - it’s just the beginning of the new one.\nHave a dog. My own one is whining at me to give her attention right now…\nHave a nice time on your journey of dreams,\nEirenei', ""Whoever has asked this question, I feel as if you are my twin. As of this moment right now, I have almost struggled with this loop of mental thought for close to 1.5 years now. (I gave CAT 2017 and am going to give CAT 2018 7 days from now).\n \n I know the personal mental hell you are in.\n \n That constant conflict you have with yourself. That you have to work but you dont want to because its so damn tough. Be it Quant, LRDI or Verbal. Be it the mocks and its awful scores or a million different things you are supposed to do or be to crack this exam.\n \n And its tough to constantly face and manage your inner demons. Procrastination is a form of avoidance to escape our fears of failure and low self esteem. We are foolish enough to hamper our own success and yet we are smart enough to recognise this about ourselves.\n \n So I just want to tell you….YOU ARE NOT ALONE.\n \n Now coming to how you can help change things for yourself.\n \n Start very very small. And just show up.\n \n Firstly now that the exam is just a week away, stop stressing about it. It won't help. Whatever you have studied, focus on it. Resolve to make as few as possible mistakes. Give mocks daily and analyze them properly. Take up additional sectionals in the areas you are having problems. Do this till 23rd November.\n \n To help with your procrastination, especially if you are addicted to your phone, download the app Flipd. It locks your phone for 12 hours (or other customized time settings)where you wont be able to use any apps except make calls and text message.\n \n Exam season is starting. If you have filled for other mba exams, go for them. Application form ke paise vasool karke aao. You may feel it's pointless but that's not the point. The point is you are not a quitter. Being a procrastinator doesnt mean you dont do the work.\n \n Since this was the second time you gave CAT, it means you are reasonably serious about B-school. Try to be free of all self judgment and fears then evaluate how you want to move ahead in your career.\n If you feel as if this has to be your last attempt then give your exams and let it be the end of that. Talk to people in the same field as yours to discuss the possible career paths and opportunities and venture forward.\n \n However, If you feel you want to give the exam again then firstly take a long holiday to properly think over your course of action. The procrastination wont be gone magically. The work will be still tough. And since its year 3, there are profile concerns too. Which means apart from studying you might have to take up activities that add value to your CV.

What are some websites for free mock CAT tests?,100+ Answers,['Mock Tests\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nWebsite Recommendations\nExam and Test Preparation\nList Question\nExams and Tests\nWhat are some websites for free mock CAT tests?'],"[""Enrol for the FREE Mocks at Cracku DASHCAT | Free Online Mocks for CAT\nAs far as Mocks are concerned, I believe that the more the merrier. Practice makes a person perfect, and there is no harm in taking (and learning) from as many Mocks as possible.\nI am a firm believer in the concept of incremental improvement. A top-notch cricketer takes every practice session seriously. He tries different things, but doesn't take a nets session casually. This is a wonderful video on how seriously Sachin used to practice as a kid.\nIn the same way, a dedicated student takes every Mock seriously. If you make a mistake or score poorly it is ok as long as the reason for failure is not lack of hard work. 'Silly Mistakes' can and should be avoided. Getting a simple multiplication wrong, shows poor concentration and a lack of desire in giving your best. Not being able to solve a tough question is ok, but solving a simple question wrong, either due to complacency or lack of effort is unpardonable.\nThings to Remember While Taking a Mock:\nStrategy: Every serious CAT aspirant should have a strategy on how to answer the exam on the day of the paper. The strategy should decide the order of answering questions and the approximate time spent in each section. In my first attempt, I spent a lot of time in Quant, which is my strength, in order to maximize my percentile. I scored very well in Quant, but as I did not clear the Verbal cut off, I did not get IIM interview calls. While distributing the time for each section, students should remember that crossing the individual cutoffs in each section is extremely important.\nAnalysis and Review: True learning does not happen without reflection. At the end of each Mock, understand whether the strategy you used is working or not. Make a list of all the mistakes you committed in the test and review these before attempting another mock. It is ok to commit mistakes, but mistakes should not be repeated.\nExecution:\nThe execution of a strategy is as important as devising a strategy. Work on implementing the ideas in this article in your next Mock CAT. A well designed and practiced strategy will help improve the confidence of a student multifold and confidence is of paramount importance on the exam day. Work hard, practice as many Mock CATs as possible and always remember, the pain of discipline is much better than the pain of defeat.\nMaruti Konduri is an alumnus of IIT Bombay and IIM Ahmedabad and is the co founder of Cracku (Cracku - Online Test Prep), an MBA entrance test preparation platform."", 'For GMAT free mock tests you can use the following resources:\n\n1.

The only thing you can have control over is your preparation and hard work. CAT is a very unpredictable exam and focusing more on your preparation rather than the end result will be more productive for you.\nYou have about 7 months for CAT 2016 (assuming that CAT 2016 will be held in the 4th week of November '16). Here I am assuming that you are writing CAT for the first time and didn't start your preparation.\nI have mentioned several tips and suggestions in this answer. Read it carefully and try and implement it.\nOther than this, you could try and stick to the following timeline for your preparation.\nPlease note, each aspirant can and should have a plan that fits him or her. These guidelines are just to give you all just a rough idea about the plan.\n1st week, May '16 - Write a mock test right now, without any preparation. This will give you a rough idea as to where you stand and on which sections you have to focus more on, be it VARC, QA, DI or LR.\nBy 2nd/3rd week of June - Try and finish study material of at least QA and LR completely and keep working on your reading and comprehension skills (refer the link provided above).\n3rd week of June to 2nd/3rd week of August - Start writing mock tests and make sure that you write at least one mock per week with proper analysis (again, refer the link provided above). Keep identifying your weak areas and keep working on them (here, writing sectional tests will help).\n3rd Week of August to 4th week of September - Now that you have  developed a rhythm, you can start experimenting for the strategy that suits you the most (say VA first, then RC. VA first, then RC 2 passages, then again VA, then remaining RCs. DI first then LR. Lots and lots of combinations possible). Once you've written 10-15 mock tests, you'll be able to identify which approach suits you the most. In this period of about 40-45 days, try and write at least 8-10 mock tests (With proper analysis of course). Identify the strategy that suits you and then stick to it for the remaining 2 months or so.\n1st week of October to 2nd week of November - Now, along with mock tests, you could increase the no. of sectional tests as well to boost up your weak section. This is a very crucial stage and you should push yourself as much as you can during this time. Write as many mocks as you can (Proper analysis is a must. Again, refer the link provided above). Keep revising the formulae regularly.\nLast 10 days or so - In this time, you can do a complete thorough revision of all the mistakes that you did, all the formulae or tricks you noted down etc. You can write 2-3 mock tests or sectional tests in this period but don't exhaust yourself with many.\n1 day before CAT - Relax. You have worked hard enough. Now, the only thing that remains is to take CAT as just another mock test and ace it.\nThis study plan along with the answer that I shared above should help you get a very good score in CAT 2016. Please understand that the points mentioned in the link provided above are very important for your preparation, so try to follow it as much as you can.\nAll the best."", ""Honestly, it is no biggie. You will be tested on your quants and verbal skills. Quants includes basic math. There is no higher level math such as calculus. As for the verbal section, it tests your grammar and reading skills. You can do the entire prep for 2 months and still get a good percentile. However, what really is important is to take as many mock tests as you can. CAT is all about the number of questions you get right within the allotted time. It is fairly easy to solve the entire paper without setting a time limit. The paper will have difficult questions. But at the same time, a fair share of easy and moderate ones. The key is to choose the right questions. The reason I'm stressing on mocks is because you'll get to experiment with the sections. Once you do that, you'll figure out a strategy that works for you. For concepts, I strongly recommend TIME institute’s videos. It costs about Rs.3000 and it is really worth the price. So once you go through the basics, do a lot of full length tests. Also, analyze them. You should be fine. All the best. :)"", 'Hello\nFirst of all if you are giving CAT for first time i would suggest you to solve 1 or 2 past CAT paper .On the basis of that you can know about your speed ,accuracy,your strong and weak points.\nAs you are starting from MAY ,this is the best possible time to start the preparation .\nAfter step 1 or if you are a retaker you would know your areas of strength and weakness .You could write it down on excel sheet your strong and weak areas ,you can mark strong areas as green and weak areas as red .You should daily put in 2-3 hrs of preparation in weak areas starting from May 16 till july 16 .Also you could do few problem of your strong areas to stay in touch with topic you know .\nIn the month of July you could enroll for mock test series ,as a fresher CL is good option.Also Handa ka Funda is a good option.The link is here-Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams You can attend a free session there to know more about it.\nYou can start with 1-2 mocks per week from July till October .Then increase it to 2-3 Mocks per week.

How should working people aiming to take the CAT manage their preparations with work?,100+ Answers,['Working Professionals Preparing for CAT Exams\nCAT Preparation\nExam Strategies\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should working people aiming to take the CAT manage their preparations with work?'],"[""I graduated now from IIM B. I prepared for CAT while I was working. I used to leave from home by 9.30 - 10 times in morning and be back in home by 9 - 10 after dinner from work. Some days, I had to stay in office late. My work comes under the category of hectic ( mentally, not physically ).\nThis is what I did for the written CAT exam.\nSpend one hour every day in the morning, going through the chapters (Apti, DI, LR). I had materials, and I went chapter by chapter some day and random questions some day. Ensured I solved 20 problems in the beginning and as I progressed the speed increased tremendously.\nIn office, open a browser tab and go to Arts & Letters Daily . Ensured I read three articles each day before I leave office. I'm generally curious, so I would read some random things without any background. Helped a lot in RC.\nThe Hindu, Business standard in browser tab in office. Read in between meetings, when I was distracted etc. But, utilize time in office. Along with wordweb.\nEveryday, walk for 20 minutes or so in the night leisurely and recite to myself\nall multiplication tables ( 1 to 20 )\nSquares of numbers, cubes of numbers\nCalculate % components for 1/2, 1/3 ... 1/15\nTake 5 random numbers and compute their squares and cubes ( short cut ways )\nI know the set of people who are preparing for CAT; we especially had a guy who is very motivated and he would provide us the problems that are challenging & we would spend time discussing quickly. Mostly casual chat types. In our office, it was appreciated to prepare for exams and hence this was easy.\nWeekends, I gave one mock test, either from home or test center. I would try to solve the problem after the exams ( the ones I was not able to find quick solutions for ) & see if there are options. This would be complete in the weekend itself.\nOverall, CAT is about being in touch with the basics. You can solve the paper if you are given twice the time. It is all about speed and accuracy. These will not come unless you are in regular touch. Allot small amounts of time every day and you will surely crack it.\nAll the best for your CAT...!!!"", ""IT IS NOT AT ALL DIFFICULT. Period. Always keep this in mind.\nCAT is an exam for which you need not put in several hours of preparation daily for months. Your preparation and performance will depend A LOT on where you stand right now. If someone is comfortable with Maths, Reasoning and/or English already, the entire preparation will revolve more around developing speed and polishing the strategy with which one approaches the paper. However, CAT is not that easy either, it is not the paper that makes this exam tough but rather, the high amount of competition.\nNote that, the major constraint for us here is TIME. So, we’ll try and do these 2 things -\nReduce investing time in unnecessary activities other than what’s really important.\nThe time that we invest in CAT prep, it must have high RoI. (So, no reading newspapers, past papers, old mock tests etc)\nKeeping this in mind, these are some key points (in no specific order) which will help you in preparing for CAT alongside working -\nGet hold of study material from any institute and make sure that you go through at least QA and LR from start to end ASAP. This is extremely important.\nA very important thing (that most people don't do) is that every time you try and solve questions, do it with time limit. It will be much more effective if you get used to solving questions in time limit from day 1.\nTry and manage 3 hours at least on alternate days, this will be needed when you write mock tests on weekdays.\nTry and utilise your travel time to office for revision. Maintain a thick notebook with all the QA formulas/tricks and LR concepts/tricks and keep updating it with every mock/sectional test you give.\nMental calculations are very important. Practice this all the time, even while working.\nInstead of investing time in novels/newspapers, invest that same amount of time in solving RC passages on various themes and topics (With a time limit of course). This way, you'll practice a lot of reading as well as you'll also practice spotting answers for questions.\nTake mock test very seriously, and its analysis even more seriously. Write a mock only if you’re sure that you can focus. Do not write a mock when you’re super tired or are sure that you’ll be disturbed in between. More importantly, focus a lot on the analysis part. Identify where you went wrong. Go through the solution of the test thoroughly and write all the new formulae/tricks mentioned in the ‘thick notebook’ mentioned above.\nOnce you start mocks, maintain an excel sheet to keep track of questions in VA and QA topic wise. After every mock, during analysis, just fill this excel sheet.\nAt the end, apply a formula that will give you details about % attempt (Attempt/Total*100) and % accuracy (Correct/Ateempt*100) topic wise. After 10-15 mocks, you'll be very clear about which topic you are attempting less, where your accuracy is pathetic etc etc. It will help you much more than you realise.\nDO NOT try to do too many things. Someone will try and do mocks, various books from Indian authors, even GMAT books, then lots of reading, then improve grammar with several grammar improvement books, then vocab improvement books, solving questions on Pagalguy, solving questions on various sites, various study materials etc etc etc. KEEP IT SIMPLE. Don't get caught up with all this. Don't ask for too many suggestions. Talk to a few good people, make a good plan that you feel will work for you and just do it.\nMaximise your efforts during the weekends, significantly reduce hanging out with friends, movies etc.\nSTOP WASTING TIME.\nTrust me, it is not difficult at all. I too did it in my first CAT attempt. I had an extremely demanding on-field job as a construction engineer and was able to spare only 2-3 hours per day 6 days a week for the preparation. On Friday (Weekend in Algeria), I used to study for around 6-8 hours. As this was my first attempt, I had to start from scratch. Moreover, I didn’t have any books or materials with me to study from so I had to look for concepts and questions on the internet. All the best.\nNEVER SETTLE"", ""CAT is very difficult to handle with 9 to 6 job, but it has to be done. I started my CAT preparation after I completed 2 years at work and finally nailed it with 1.5 years of preparation. I have experienced how difficult it is to maintain work-life balance. Thus, preparing CAT along with work is next to impossible for many. Thus, it leads to two extreme steps. Either the aspirant leaves his job or he leaves his dream of an IIM tag.\nLeaving the job for CAT is too risky because of the unpredictability of the exam. If you are thinking of taking the other step, then this post is not for you. You may scroll down to read some other post.\nI am assuming the following conditions are satisfied to follow the steps mentioned in this post:\n1. Saturday & Sunday off. (Weekend off)\n2. Total time 12 hours outside the home. (Office + travel time + etc.)\n3. You have only one goal in your life and i.e. CAT.\nSome of you may get off on some other days or work unevenly on various days. So for the people whom the above assumptions are not valid. Please accommodate the schedule as per your ease.\n1. Treat each section equally: - Considering the increasing difficulty level of DI & LR with every passing year and high unpredictability of VA, do not live under the veil that you can cover one section with another. Focus on all the sections.\n2. Weekdays: - On weekdays allocate 6 (8-2 = 6) hrs. for studying (2 hrs. for each of the four sections mentioned below)\n(i) QA: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals/books. You can use any of the two mocks (IMS, Time).\n(ii) DI/LR: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals. You can use any of the three mocks (IMS, CL, Time). Practice as many sets as you can.\n(iii) VA/RC: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals. IMS mocks provides you the closest RC that you may get in CAT. You can practice from Time also but RC from Time is a bit lengthy and contains a bit easier question. The VA/RC section of last two years CAT was most similar to IMS mocks. You can use office time to practice old mocks, sectional, etc. (Given you utilize the time judiciously. Trust me, it is achievable.)\n(iv) Newspaper Reading (The Hindu Editorial): - This should be finished at the office. Do not carry this task to home. 9 to 6 job provides you enough free time to read the newspaper. If you do not get enough time during lunch or while traveling, then you can follow other alternatives. Copy the editorial/article and paste it in either XLSX or notepad and read it. This way you will be at your cubicle and can utilize your time well. Do this whenever you get free time. Don't restrict yourself to only newspaper and diversify your readings.\n3. Weekends/Holidays: - On weekends/ holidays allocate minimum 12.5 hrs. for studying.\n(i) 7.5 hrs. for studying (2.5 hrs. to each section).\n(ii) 3 hrs. for mock.\n(iii) 2 hrs. for mock analysis.\n4. Till August: - You should finish QA theory & formulas, all concepts of DI & LR and the basic understanding of different question types in VA & RC.\n5. September & October: -\n(i) You should only do revision and attempt mocks and sectionals.\n(ii) You Should give at least 2 mocks each weekend with their analysis. Do not miss any center-based mocks. Attempt them at the center to prepare yourself for the exam like scenarios. (It will make you feel comfortable on D day).\n6. Last month (November): -\n(i) 1 mock each day and along with its analysis.\n(ii) I would advise taking a month leave before CAT. If it is not possible then take at least 2 weeks off before the exam and give mocks at exactly the exam time.\n7. Meanwhile, take out time to pursue your hobbies. Keep in mind CAT is not the end, it is just the beginning of your DREAM.\nAll the Best.

Verbal preparation is not really prep prep but something that needs to be done over a long period\n2. Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation requires vast exposure to different kind of questions and logic(s)\n3. A simple formula based approach and sticking to level of difficulty 1-2-3 in Quant is good enough\n\nAlso read: Prasad Sawant\'s answer to Does CAT 2015 Stands a benchmark for future test pattern?\n\nWhen you are taking a second attempt at a test like this, your preparation strategy is quite different from your first attempt strategy.\n\nFirst attempt is like learning how to swim. You flounder, you need help, your strokes are without finesse and you somehow manage to stay afloat. And unless you do that, you don\'t reach the next level. But once you have learned what\'s required, you become better. Then you focus on cutting the water at a certain angle, perfecting your strokes, increase your lung capacity and strength, and finally, you become a good swimmer.\n\nComing back to your question, let\'s start planning your day:\nWork day: 24 hours - (9 hours of work, 2 hours of travel, 7 hours of sleep, 2 hours of food, 2 hours of buffer time spent on in-between activities & fun) = 2 hours\nNon-work day: 24 hours - (10 hours of sleep, 2 hours of food, 5 hours of buffer time spent on in-between activities & fun) = 7 hours\n\nAssuming you are dedicated enough, you will roughly have about 24 hours per week for preparation. This time can be divided as (Strong section: 7 hours, Moderate section: 8 hours, ""I-am-not-good-at-this"" section: 9 hours)\n\nPreparation means: Understanding concepts + solving questions without time limit/with time limit. One of the biggest mistakes before the second attempt is confusing familiarity and conceptual clarity. In the first six months of the calendar year, focus on preparation. In the remaining five months, focus on mocks and test taking strategy and practice.\n\nThe reason why I am not sharing a time table and talking broadly in terms of hours is because I think everyone is different and needs to have a custom plan. Only you can draft that for yourself. The next thing is to sustain the motivation and having a discipline to stick to that plan (DIFFICULT part)\n\nPost June/July, you should not feel the need to go back to the concepts book. The idea of putting more hours in the first six months is to reduce to effort required in the second half. People start getting serious 2 months before the CAT when it\'s already late. Then nothing helps.\n\nAlso, before you start your plan for CAT 2016, sit and do a thorough analysis of your last year preparation and performance. What different things are you going to do this time to ensure a significantly better result?\n\nCreate a monthly plan which is further divided in weeks and days. Keep a little buffer in case a topic is difficult to understand or long. Extreme specificity might not be required (for e.g. morning 30 minutes on 27th January for understanding sum of roots from algebra) but a broad topic wise and section wise plan is better.\n\nOnce the plan is in place, understand what material will help you achieve it. Coaching institute material + past papers + 2-3 good books should suffice. Apart from that, focus on reading anything and everything to improve your VA RC skills and Puzzles and brain teasers to improve your overall aptitude.\n\nIf you have specific things to ask, you can always message me.

This fake 22.1% did change to real 94.8 but to note- everything changed since then. This is what happened\nThe transition phase:-\n1) Read, Read and Read is what I was told would help me, and I must say- It saved me.\n2) 1–2 hours of study on weekdays and 5 hrs of serious study over weekends.\n3) A daily dosage of Sudoku, The Hindu’s editorial page and Testfunda’s wordlist.\n4) VA ate my mind with a daily practise of atleast 50 questions\n5) Quantum CAT by Sarvesh K verma, a friend who walks me through all such possible questions that could trouble me in the CAT exam\n6) Frequent beer breaks to keep me alive :P\n7) TIME AIMCAT series to help you get a feel of CAT.\n8) Weekly 3 mock CATs\n9) Strength & Weakness analysis for my mock CATs (Weakness in my case :P).

For CAT strategy, two things are necessary: one is you focus on smart concepts, those that you can possibly apply in the exam time to save a few seconds; and the second is proper mock-examination ethic. To expand on the first, there are many possible ways to solve a question and some tricks might be necessary to build a good base of knowledge. Here, I will like to touch upon another topic, ‘Is coaching necessary to crack CAT?’ . I will like to answer this in a very realistic way, it is a post graduation examination and most of you would be busy with jobs and college studies. To cover all necessary tricks across these 10–11 months is nearly impossible if you go about studying from books only. Unless you have really good basics and supporting work-ethic, I will advice you to garner support in the form of a coaching. But, which coaching? This is a really important question. I took support from an online coaching, Elites Grid after extensive research on both online and offline coaching. It is a Delhi-based coaching and you can join the offline batch as well if you live in the vicinity. I will suggest you to look into it for some reasons as cited below:\n1: The faculty is exceptional: Hemant Malhotra, Shahzar Khan and Gaurav Kapoor are phenomenal mentors. Hemant Malhotra would take up Quants and LR-DI and Shahzar Khan VA-RC. Gaurav Kapoor will make you practice over questions from all three sections. The personal support throughout the preparation and doubt-solving with lengthy explanations slowly builds a great mindset for the final three hours.\n2: Question-base is exceptional: I have covered questions from TIME, IMS, Bullseye, TestFunda, Cracku etc. Though the TIME and IMS material is something I would still recommend, but they issue their basic packages in early season and though the packages are replete with questions, but the standard of these basic packages are not at par with CAT. There final packages for CAT and other exams are really good, but you get them in May-June, which is a bit late. Here, from the Day 1 you are exposed to questions ranging from Greenhorn to Brutal level, so you have an ample amount of time to build the right mind-set.\n3: Doubt-solving: This is one of the major parts of preparation for any competitive examination but is grossly underestimated. You might face a plethora of doubts through your preparation, and you would need someone to solve them with efficient methods. In offline coaching, you will have to wait up for a class, and by then you might lose out on the flow, but here, you can shoot up your query and both the mentor and the entire batch of students stand at your beck and call. Also, you get more than one approach to solve out the problem, which is absolutely perfect.\n4: Value of time: You will be preparing throughout an year and it matters what you gain out of this time. Though a 100 percentile seems enough of a reward right now for your hard-work, but trust me, you can get way more here. The mentors are both counsellors and they help you on conundrums bigger than a CAT score. This matters much more on retrospection.\nNow, coming to the second part the ‘proper mock-examination ethic’, this is another under-rated portion for the examination. CAT is much more about time-management and introspection on your skill-set than knowledge. Knowledge only gets you half-way through the path. You will need to work on your actual examination ethic and understand how you behave in the examination. Do you miss question that were easy? Do you spend more time on a harder set where you could have fetched double marks through easier ones? Should I read the passage or skim? Should I go with my gut? It is a never-ending list. The following points might help you to achieve the most of the mocks:\n1:Knowledge about your skill-set: What are you good at? Arithmetic or Geometry? RC or Para-jumbles? And so on and so forth. It helps a lot to know your strengths and weaknesses. Work correspondingly to get better results.\n2: Your attitude: This is one thing that is actually very important. Do I stick to questions and lose time? Am I biased in my approach to topics? Example, I used to find sets from Games and Tournaments very hard, so I used to never attempt them in first-go until one day I realised that I was attempting harder sets due to my bias on the topic.\n3: Proper paper-ethic and analysis: These mocks are not just to be done and left-out, they are to be analysed at length, the marks are not to be compared with peers but with yourself. There are three columns except the sectional and total scores and percentiles. First, “Comments”- Here you will jot down the overall analysis summary-like it was a brutal DI-LR but I did satisfactory. Made 1 silly mistake…..and so on. Second, “Sectional scope”- this would be how much could you have scored on a section more, REALISTICALLY. As in you wasted about 6 mins in a question and could not see the last three questions out of which two were easy. So your scope is +3 only, coz you did one correct, but you could have done two. Third is “Immediate Need”, here you will list out the major flaw. When you keep jotting this down, you get huge insights to work through your flaws.\nFocus on sectionals as well, for that go for sectional mocks. A combination of TIME and IMS mock-tests are recommended. Take an aim of 50 full length mocks and 30 sectional mocks for each section at least throughout the preparation. You can also try BullsEye for the start until IMS starts it mock-series.\nThe above strategy with mentors from Elites Grid helped me immensely to succeed.\nWebsite for Elites Grid: Elite Grid Academy\nCAT 2018 Strategy (Elites Grid) -https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=h...\nELITES GRID LINK OF CAT 2018 COURSE- Log into Facebook | Facebook\nYou might need to access the group for that place a request to join.\nLink for some recommended books, would be adding more soon\nBooks - Google Drive\nHope this helps, and ALL THE BEST.']"
"What can I do now, as I think I am stuck in a loop for a while now (procrastinating, lazy, unhealthy, running away from things, making excuses) (wanted to do MBA, gave cat in 2017 without preparation and without a job and doing the same again?",5 Answers,"['Overcoming Procrastination\nLaziness\nProcrastination\nCAT Preparation\nTime Management\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nMaster of Business Administration Degrees\nLife Advice\nExams and Tests\nCareer Advice\nWhat can I do now, as I think I am stuck in a loop for a while now (procrastinating, lazy, unhealthy, running away from things, making excuses) (wanted to do MBA, gave cat in 2017 without preparation and without a job and doing the same again?']","['I faced the same dilemma . Hence, you should know there are many like us. As a caveat, the following is very specific to me. I put it all out there to hopefully benefit someone, who can identify with me.\nI realized I had a problem focusing and concentrating. Procrastination got me down to the wire. Then laser focus and concentration kicked in. It took the pressure of an exam being imminent to put me into overdrive. I pulled all nighters all the time. I was lost and stuck. Eventually , I decided to get professional help. I was prescribed Adderall, for ADD. ( attention deficit disorder ) . I continued to see this Doctor . Subsequently, I was diagnosed as suffering from clinical depression.\nIt became clear that the lack of motivation was caused by depression, not laziness. The depression prevented me from thinking clearly and from having the energy to help myself. The ADD just exacerbated the entire painful predicament.\nAs said above, this is very specific to me and may not apply to you. However, I do highly recommend in general you see a Doctor for a complete physical. I had a complete , extremely thorough blood test. It was discovered I was EXTREMELY deficient in Vitamin D , which has many significant negative effects. Also, Vitamin D is one that is easy to become deficit in. Additional, the physical and bold test revealed a few other problems which were addressed.\nLearn more about yourself. Maybe the difficulties and hurdles because you know you are on the wrong course. Family pressures, peer pressure, societal pressure may be forcing you to be blinded and have tunnel vision. You have sources all around you can tap into to help you navigate this part of your life. Trusted friends, trusted family members, trusted professors, trusted professionals, reputable vocational testers and advisors. A trite but maybe applicable, think outside the box, pursue anything you had thoughts of doing at anytime in your life, even when you were very young. When I did that I realized I wanted to be an investigative journalist. I am on a different career path which I like, However, I incorporated the aforementioned into my life .\nIn my opinion, there are no quick fixes, nor sometimes not a total cure. Ongoing vigilance, doing the right things, listening to others who are there to help you, dedication, and hard work are necessary .\nI sincerely hope the foregoing helps you, I wish you the very best. Please note, I made it through, so will you.\nPhilip', 'Start with one small step. For example, do a small walk today. And do one tomorrow. It doesn’t need to be long, but the important thing is that you make it…. every day, come rain and shine. No excuses.\nStart exercising. Even half an hour would do - there are many exercise videos on internet, so you have your own pick of them, so you can choose one that you like, but be mindful not to begin with the hardest one from the onset. That just leads to failure and depression. My personal pick is Hip Hop Abs, because I love to dance. Once again, half an hour per day.\nClean out your living space. You could be surprised just how much cleaning out the junk can motivate you to make additional changes in your life. In addition, you will find things you need quicker, so that’s a bonus!\nLook at what you eat and change it, if necessary. Small steps here, too. So, more home-cooked meals - cooking for yourself can be fun, because it’s like having mini-experiments - and there are many recipes on the net. So, vegetables, meat and some carbs on the side along with avoiding fast food and sweets.\nDrink water. This is one of the simplest things, but you wouldn’t believe just how much it can help you. If you drink alcoholic beverages or sweet beverages, cut them out, because they slow down your mind and make you fat. Switch to water or unsweetened tea. Coffee is also an option.\nTake some of your time to help others, for example, volunteering to help teenagers with the subjects they have trouble with, or helping in pet shelter. Or become a volunteer. Social interactions matter, and it gives you wider perspective of the world. Choose one and try it. I don’t promise it will be easy, but it is worth it.\nHave a good look at what you want to do. What are you dreams, end goals. It’s not an end of the world if you failed, because you can begin anew. Yes, it will be hard, but if you are serious about it, you won’t accept excuses - only results. Find people to support you, and most importantly, hold you accountable.\nGive you permission to let go of your previous ‘failures’. Learn to forgive yourself. That blame game is the worst thing you could’ve done to yourself. You’ve failed one, and it’s in your mind even now, thousand times later. You think you won’t succeed in anything, ever, because you haven’t gone on to MBA. But I assure you, this is not the case. Having MBA is cool, but what is even more cool, is that you are human, kind, empathetic, honest. Your dreams can just as easily be realized without MBA degree, if you really want them to be realized as such. Sometimes, MBA doesn’t fit in our dreams, because there is no real MBA for dreams, for being a rock star or writer or fashion designer or whatever you want to be. Trust yourself to be successful even without degree, and if you still aim for MBA, then trust yourself to achieve it.\nAsk for help. It’s alright to be one who doesn’t know, who is confused. No person knows everything. If you are stuck, ask for help.\nEducate yourself. Knowledge is the one thing that matters when going through life. Educate yourself in finances - how to make a budget for your living, how to make savings, how to ask for a raise… Educate yourself in things that interest you. Try them out. Just for the kicks of it. Learn something new, maybe languages or how to knit or how to play an instrument, whatever you want.\nGo out of your comfort zone. Travel somewhere, even if it’s just one day trip. You will find world different, and you will have to take care of yourself to get to destination and back.. but it will be fun!\nAs for job… Read through the free material of Ramit Sethi’s. Learn to write a good CV. Learn to present yourself, and learn to negotiate. Yes, this is not taught in school, so you will have to learn it by yourself. You will make mistakes, there will be rejections, but if your persist and improve on yourself, then yes, you can get a job. Don’t settle for less - settle for what you actually want to do and do everything to get it.\nRead books. Sounds strange, but it can help you. Go to library, browse, see what book grabs your interest, and read it. Books are miniature worlds that can give you much, if you only take time and give them a shot.\nTake some time off. To relax. I am not asking you to do all of the suggestions in one go - but give them a shot to work them constantly. Progress may be small at the beginning, but it will be noticeable, the longer you are making the strides. It will take time to trust yourself because you are still blaming yourself for not getting that MBA. But it’s not end of the world - it’s just the beginning of the new one.\nHave a dog. My own one is whining at me to give her attention right now…\nHave a nice time on your journey of dreams,\nEirenei', ""Whoever has asked this question, I feel as if you are my twin. As of this moment right now, I have almost struggled with this loop of mental thought for close to 1.5 years now. (I gave CAT 2017 and am going to give CAT 2018 7 days from now).\n \n I know the personal mental hell you are in.\n \n That constant conflict you have with yourself. That you have to work but you dont want to because its so damn tough. Be it Quant, LRDI or Verbal. Be it the mocks and its awful scores or a million different things you are supposed to do or be to crack this exam.\n \n And its tough to constantly face and manage your inner demons. Procrastination is a form of avoidance to escape our fears of failure and low self esteem. We are foolish enough to hamper our own success and yet we are smart enough to recognise this about ourselves.\n \n So I just want to tell you….YOU ARE NOT ALONE.\n \n Now coming to how you can help change things for yourself.\n \n Start very very small. And just show up.\n \n Firstly now that the exam is just a week away, stop stressing about it. It won't help. Whatever you have studied, focus on it. Resolve to make as few as possible mistakes. Give mocks daily and analyze them properly. Take up additional sectionals in the areas you are having problems. Do this till 23rd November.\n \n To help with your procrastination, especially if you are addicted to your phone, download the app Flipd. It locks your phone for 12 hours (or other customized time settings)where you wont be able to use any apps except make calls and text message.\n \n Exam season is starting. If you have filled for other mba exams, go for them. Application form ke paise vasool karke aao. You may feel it's pointless but that's not the point. The point is you are not a quitter. Being a procrastinator doesnt mean you dont do the work.\n \n Since this was the second time you gave CAT, it means you are reasonably serious about B-school. Try to be free of all self judgment and fears then evaluate how you want to move ahead in your career.\n If you feel as if this has to be your last attempt then give your exams and let it be the end of that. Talk to people in the same field as yours to discuss the possible career paths and opportunities and venture forward.\n \n However, If you feel you want to give the exam again then firstly take a long holiday to properly think over your course of action. The procrastination wont be gone magically. The work will be still tough. And since its year 3, there are profile concerns too. Which means apart from studying you might have to take up activities that add value to your CV. This means more work and less time.\n \n You (and I) will have to figure out how to balance our procrastination and our work so that we can do this. You will have to create a very rigid schedule to get the desired results. Rigid not in terms of time schedules but the work done every day. I am saying this all to you but I am going to have to do this myself as well.\n \n I myself have a very vague idea beyond the next week but the main motto is just show up every day.\n \n Good luck for everything!\n Cheers!"", 'First, acknowledge you have created the loop, even if uncondciously and without knowing why.If you do so you will recognise your creativity can also be applied consciously..then, you will appreciate where you have been, because you will know the difference when you start to growing. This is why we all have similar periods in our life .In our collective memory, we didnt have many choices in life…today, they can feel overwhealming.']"
How was your CAT 2018 paper?,12 Answers,['CAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExams and Tests\nHow was your CAT 2018 paper?'],"[""I wrote cat for the third time in a row. I had admission offers from new and baby iims but I decided to give it one more shot. The biggest blunder I had done was to leave my job. And before you read any further let me advice you not to do the same, no matter what. So, my exam was in slot 2. The day earlier I watched friends and andaz apna apna to cool down. I had given around 35 mocks, so I was pretty confident that I'm gonna nail it.\nOn the exam day the biometric and every thing went smooth.Then starts the exam. Varc has not been my favorite, but I went there with a mindset just to clear the cutoffs. In cat 2016 I failed to clear sectional in this and had paid the price. To my surprise VA seemed pretty easy. Rc were readable but had few tricky questions with closer options. I managed to mark 24 somehow. God knows at what accuracy. I was relieved after this section as the nightmare I thought was over.\nDilr is something I enjoy. I love solving puzzles. I was prepared for a tough section but to my surprise there were 2 extremely easy sets which everyone must have attempted. I cracked 4 sets in about 50 min. But got carried away while solving 5th one. And the section got locked.\nQa is my forte. I've scored 99pc in qa for 2016&17 cat. And as all the IIMs were boasting about diversity and all, nearly every mock from every institute had easy qa section. Maybe that's why people are crying alot over qa. I went through the paper to find that the section is difficult. I started with round strategy but not many were lower hanging fruits. Also, the problems and calculations as well, were lengthy and took time. I managed to solve 21 questions here.\nOverall, I enjoyed the paper. I didn't feel as much heat as people are shouting and crying. It was a pretty decent paper. All the papers in 2002–2008 were far far difficult than this one.People got to remember one thing, if it was hard for you it will be same for everyone. In this case lower attempts could fetch you great percentile. What matters the most in this case is the accuracy.\nCat 2016- 95pc\nCat 2017–96.9 pc\nEdit; Those asking aboout leaving job-\nyes its extremely difficult to manage prep with job in hand. but believe me when you go for an interview, they grill you based on the same. there will be many with great profiles + job experience. So, the panel will ask you if they did manage to, what was the problem in your case? until and unless you have a stellar profile or very strong reason i recommend not doing so. Maybe you can find a job where you dont have to devote full attention for the whole day.\nAbout QA- Cause I'm a mechanical engineer, and this is what we do! I mean, we may be not great readers, don't read a lot, or run very fast... but damn it, we can crunch numbers and solve QA."", ""My exam was in slot 1.\nFirst let me give a brief about my profile:\n10th | 12th | Graduation - 96% | 89.3% | GPA - 7.3\nWork experience - 3 years.\nCAT 2017 - 84.5 %ile.\nNow, My CAT 2018 attempts are :\nVARC(28), LRDI(20), QA(18)\nI was quite confident before the exam as i knew that i was well prepared for the exam. I had taken about 30 full length mock tests that helped me a lot to manage the time and make a guess about the difficulty level of questions.\nAll thanx to my mock test practice, I made it a habit to spend first 5 minutes in analyzing the questions and determining the order in which i would attempt question.\nVARC\nRC were based on common topics like second world war, Consumer behavior etc. So, I didnt find any much difficulty in understanding the context of the passage. Strikingly i found the passages to be or shorter length( I was expecting long passages and had practiced alot). As the usual trend of CAT, most of the questions were based on inferences and had confusingly similar options but I was well taught the tricks to handle these question by my mentors. So, after a bit brainstorming I used to get to the correct answer.\nI did plastic pollution passage at first as I found it relatively easy followed by passages on world war and then consumer behavior.\nVerbal portion was very similar to last years paper. I didn’t find much in verbal portion worthy of talking.\nOverall, VARC was confusing but of moderate difficulty level.\nLRDI\nLRDI portion is generally considered the toughest part of CAT exam and It proved to be the one. Even after determining the sequence in which i would attempt the section, i was stuck in the very first LR. I spend about 12 minutes there but the good part was i somehow managed to find the answers to all the questions.\nOverall, LRDI portion was Difficult. I talked to a lot of people at my center and most of them had attempted 15 or less.\nQuants\nI personally felt geometry was the toughest part of QA section. IIMC maintained its legacy of setting the worst QA paper.\nThere were a lot of NON-MCQ questions. Despite that the difficulty level of the section was touching heights. I felt the QA section was filled with Arithmetic questions. So, It became a bit lengthy also.\nOverall, Quants section came as a surprise to those who don’t know the trend of IIMC. We were warned about this by our mentors. So, we were on the safe side.\nI checked my response sheet with the answer key released by various institutes. My wrong attempts are:\nVARC - 2(Negative marking Ques) + 2( Non - negative/TITA)\nLRDI- 1(Negative Marking)\nQuants- 1 (TITA)\nThese are my wrong attempts.\nAfter doing the required mathematics, I am getting 177 marks.\nFor this score, I am quiet confident of getting 99+ percentile, rest depends on the level of competition.\nIf you want to know about the my CAT journey and best coaching institutes for CAT visit my answer.\nAyush Bhatnagar's answer to Which is the best MBA coaching institute in Delhi? How is it better than the other institutes?\nFor any help, you can message me.\nPlease upvote if this helps you."", '100%ile aspirers can skip the answer.\nI gave up CAT preparation in august as I thought my preparation was going no where, my mock scores didn’t cross 100 marks and I seriously thought of giving GATE another chance. But I don’t think my giving up affected my CAT score phenomenally because of following reasons:\nVA/RC:\nI am pretty good at RC. I read books to my extent, so no problem in VARC I attempted 25 questions (Dunno about accuracy though) but I did my level best.\nDI/LR:\nThe actual reason I gave up CAT because I thought DI/LR being tough and I got single digit marks and attempted questions in single digit only in mocks. So, I would not make it to 99%ile zone,so no IIM calls, so no MBA. So, I gave up and started preparing GATE but as I was in exam hall and solving sets, I had feeling that it didn’t have anything which needed stupendous amount of practice and solving all the difficult sets from mocks and books. Definitely tough section but key to success lies in finding easy sets and a medium set, so that you solve 12–16 questions correctly and you will be through. There will be no time to solve more questions than that and if somebody tells you he/she solved more than that it means they have affected their accuracy. Solve 15–18 questions with full accuracy and you will have 99%ile. I solved 13 questions.(Dunno about accuracy though). Easy sets will be time consuming.\nBekar Ki Mehnat Mat Karo\nQuant:\nDefinitely tough and was a very unpleasant surprise. CAT quants from 2015–17 was very easy. If you knew basic maths you could solve but this year quant had questions which needed practice (a lot of practice precisely) and if my giving up affected CAT score it was in this area. I knew after the exam that if I hadn’t given up I would have scored well. I attempted 11 questions(Dunno about accuracy though). Before attempting even one question 20 minutes elapsed and somebody was cutting onions near me because I had tears in my eyes during quant (They shouldn’t allow onions in exam hall)\nThoughts for the CAT:\nCAT became my favorite exam as it tests intelligence rather than memory (Though You should remember few formula but it’s only few)\nThere is no need of coaching. I took online coaching but it didn’t affect my performance.\nAll you need for CAT exam is Arun Sharma’s book and nothing else. Please follow no other book especially for DI/LR.\nCertain amount of practice more than enough(2 hours per day for 5 months)\nDon’t give up on exam otherwise you will regret like me later\nEnjoy your learning days without stressing too much and please don’t feed your mind with plethora of questions, sets and passages because if exam is tough then it will be tough for all and everybody is human like you and will work hard only as much as you are.( If you are working quite hard though)\nBefore exam meditate by chanting OM.\nBANAT BANAT BAN JAI——LAHIRI MAHASAYA', 'I started my prep in june this year, was regular with mocks and practice . Then comes the D-day, I had 2nd slot. I was pretty confident before the exam started, n believed that whatever questions might come, I have prepared well to answer them well.\n1.VARC\nI started with verbal ability questions, spent some 12 minutes on it and could do only 5and then did other 5 in the end.I found the summary questions difficult which had to be read twice to get the gist.\nRCs were a bit lengthy as compared to 2017. What surprised me was that there were hardly any direct questions. Like many people, i didn’t focus much on CR during my prep, which i kind of regretted during the exam.\nAttempted 25\n2. DILR\nOn a first glance, sets looked easier. However, the sets which looked easy were found to be difficult after spending some minutes on them, which were obviously wasted. Then I knew that some difficult were recognized then , and then attempted 17 questions in about 48 mimutes.\n3. QA (the game changer)\nHere comes the most difficult section of CAT 2018. I was very much confident about QA. After reading some 3–4 questions, I came to realize that QA is not going to be easy. Another surprise was that there were more no. of arithmetic questions which i was not comfortable with. Then I took a deep breathe, started solving easier ones from other topics, solved some 15 questions in first 40 mins. and another 10 in remaining 20 mins.\nSo overall, paper was moderate, with some surprises , and lessons for CAT 19 aspirants.']"
Which is the best test series for CAT?,80 Answers,['Indian Institute of Management Exams and Tests\nCollege and University Exams in India\nIndian Institute of Management Admissions\nCAT Preparation\nIndian Institutes of Management\nHigher Education in India\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExams and Tests\nWhich is the best test series for CAT?'],"[""Let me make it clear that I too have my own test series for CAT which I create. So could be little biased. Obviously I believe that my test series is best. As I take enough time per question to make it like a CAT like question - which is difficult. But since I am answering the question, I will put aside my test series and focus mainly on the test series of IMS, Time and CL. Can't comment on others as I don't have much idea.\nFor the verbal section I would rate IMS the best. From what I have heard from the students who have cracked CAT, they really liked the quality of Verbal section of IMS.\nHere IMS > CL > Time\nFor the Quant section, CL would be better than the other two. Their questions are more closer to the type of questions CAT makes. As a matter of fact a lot of questions of CL are inspired by the previous CAT questions. In this section I would rate\nCL > IMS > Time\nFor DI/LR the more you practice different type of sums the better it is as it is quite unpredictable what type of questions will come in the exam. In this case all the three test series are more or less similar in nature. Here again I don't like the quality of Time questions and would rate the other two better.\nCL/IMS > Time\nI don't like the Time test series because they don't seem to have made a proper research of the CAT paper before they make the paper. CL has a good team on the top (unfortunately they have not been able to pass on this expertise at the centre level) . Gautam Puri has a great understanding of CAT and Gejo (whom I have worked with) is excellent.\nOverall I would rate the CL test series best among the three followed by IMS.\nSo overall CL > IMS > Time.\nI would recommend students to solve test series of different classes. Each class has a different style and solving different test series helps to understand different styles. The actual exam is difficult to predict and could be closer to any of the test series that are available. If you are a group of friends, you could join different test series and then share. Each solving a few tests from the different test series.\nTo join a CAT 100%ile group in facebook join : Log into Facebook | Facebook\nFor free CAT Preparation WhatsApp group can WhatsApp to 9821314788.\nWebsite: PatrickCAT100Percentile"", ""I have taken CAT 4 times including 2 serious attempts and I have had experience with 4-5 different test series.\n\nOut of these 5, I would recommend joining TestFunda and IMS and definitely recommend against joining TIME. I have provided reasons for the same below:\n\nWhy join TestFunda?\nSimilar to CAT, Flexible\n\nThey were quite good and similar to CAT level. The best part about TF is that you get the solutions, the moment you give the mocks. It will make a huge difference. You can start analyzing your mocks as soon as you finish your paper. This is because there is no window as such for TestFunda where you have to take the mock. There is only a fixed date on which the mock becomes available and after that you can take it whenever you like.\nAlso the sectional tests from TestFunda were quite good. This is also one of the cheapest Test series available.\n\nWhy IMS?\nVery close to CAT\n\nI did not take the IMS Simcats in 2014, but I have seen the papers from my friends. They have always been quite similar to the actual CAT. Also, I believe they have decent number of mocks for practice. I have always heard good things about the SIMCATS from students and teachers alike.\n\nExperience with Career Launcher:\nDifficulty level was good, except LRDI\n\nI had joined CL when I was preparing for CAT 2013. The LR that CL gives in its mocks is very easy is what I realized. During CAT 2013, my LR set was tough. This happened with me in CAT 2014 too, but this time I was better prepared with TestFunda and certain LR sets from TIME as well. I thought CL's Verbal was quite good, even its Quant, but not its LRDI\n\nWhy not TIME?\nDifficulty level above CAT in general, miles above CAT 2014. Usually declare their mock results quite late.\n\nI went for the AIMCAT enchanced package last year. It was quite expensive at INR 7,200 I thought. Initial few papers were okay. They say the difficulty level rises slowly as you give the AIMCATS, somewhere in the middle it reaches the peak of its difficulty and later on in reduces. But I somehow don't agree with this. May be its the psychological thing, but by the time you finish the supposedly toughest AIMCATs, you are so low on confidence and scared of AIMCATs, that you somehow start doing worse in subsequent tests. May be this is just me, but I am giving you my opinion.\n\nAlso, TIME Verbal is way too weird. They ask the longest passages you will ever see, of course, and the questions?? Well..the questions are sometimes passages in themselves. I have taken CAT for 4 years, I have never seen such long passages or questions and their options EVER.\n\nEven in general, TIME tries to modify and make the questions way too tough. I know they say that the idea behind this is to prepare you for the worst, but I never bought this logic. I think confidence is also important, the most important thing probably.\n\nAdd to the above the delay in declaring their results. For ex: You will write the exam on a Sunday. Depending on which end of the window you have booked the slot, it will often happen that the results are declared after a week. By that time mostly, you would have forgotten about the mock you gave, what exactly you were thinking while answering certain questions and thus, your analysis won't be as effective.\n\nAlso, a lot of people argue that AIMCATs will give a truer picture of where you stand considering that it is the most popular Test Series (about 20K takers), but I dont think it matters too much. If you are aiming high, only the top 1000 are your competitors. CL has close to 7-8K takers (decent), IMS has close to 5-6k takers(quite good again). Test Funda may be 4k max, (but still worth it)\n\nIn a nutshell my sugestion is avoid AIMCATs, I would suggest this order: TestFunda > IMS > BullsEye > CL > TIME\n\nIf you want to go for 2, for for the first two. Also, apart from these you will get free Mocks from BullsEye too which are actually pretty good. You will get them free on the basis of securing 90+ percentile in any of the other Test Series.\n\nI don't have experience with others, so can't comment on them. But I have tried to objectively assess the Test series I have had experience with. Hope it helps."", 'I wont say the best or the worst. I have tried out different test series and found some pros and cons in them. I will lay out my thought process.\nTIME-AIMCATs\nPros:\nHas a good student base and gives an idea of the competition you will face.\nTheir Handouts and materials are good. You can learn a lot of short-cuts.\nTheir QA section is at par.\nCons:\nVA section (especially the RCs) are majorly pseudo-intellectual, longish. Definitely not a good option to try out. If you are a fan of the book Animal Farm written by George Orwell, then you might find their RCs worth reading. Else, its just a pile of arrant non-sense.\nScores become demotivating after a few mocks. Frustration starts to build exponentially a month before the actual exam.\nNot a good post-exam analysis.\n2. CL- Mocks:\nPros:\nDecently CAT level type of questions. Sectional tests are good as well.\nVA section is quite reasonable. (sometimes annoying).\nComparably better post-exam analysis compared to TIME\nCons:\nStudent base is not as large as TIME’s , but comparable enough.\nI hate their inter-face of MOCK-CAT (especially the unproctored ones which we take at home). I am a working guy and I can manage to take tests only during night-hours. Last year, their server crashed multiple times during a single mock and ultimately when I received the scores, many of my answers were not recorded.\n3. Test Funda:\nPros:\nAn excellent post- exam analysis, complete with graphs and areas where to improve.\nTheir skill-builder is quite expensive for a person who lives on a budget, but quite worth it of you are serious about this exam.\nMocks are quite moderate in LOD (my experience is subjective, so please take this with a pinch of salt).\nCons:\nStudent base is not large. (hardly around 10k per test).\nYour percentile keeps changing as more people take the test. So cannot be used as a measure to judge the competition you face.\n4. Bulls Eye:\nPros:\nQuestions are more balanced. Especially the Verbal RCs are doable.\nA healthy mix of questions.\nCons:\nSmall student base. So you would have no idea of the competition.\nPost exam analysis is not attractive as Test Funda’s or CLs.\nOverall, it would be difficult for me to put one series over the another. It depends on your motivations. Some suggestions:\nIf you want to have an idea of the competition you would face, I recommend you join TIME AIMCAT.\nIf you want a good post exam analysis where you can identify your strong and weak areas - you can go for Test Funda.\nIf you have additional time to kill and money to spare, enroll for Bulls-Eye.\nIf you are stupid, enroll for Crack-U.', ""Thanks for the A2A guys!!\nThis is a strictly opinion based question. There is nothing like the best test series OR a test series without which you can't make it to IIMs.\nI had read a few answers to this question and found all of them criticizing TIME's AIMCATs, while in retrospect I did fine while only subscribing to their AIMCATs.\nI will discuss the parameters for deciding the test series which can boost your preparation: -\nMost important is the no. of people taking the test series. Higher the number of aspirants taking a test series, more accurate will be the percentile score.\nNext is the level of test series. IMHO, the level should always be slightly above the general CAT level for each section. This will bring out competitiveness in you while pushing you to reach better scores and higher goals. An easy test series where 20 people are scoring 250+ (out of 300) will make you over confident and hence injure your preparation.\nAnother point is whether test series cover all topics adequately, this is imperative to make you analyze all the portions and hence analyze where are you weak or which section do you avoid when the time ticks.\nThen there is availability of analysis and solution with details of score vs rank in the test series for top 10% candidates at least. Also, there should be section wise score, analysis, ranks and all the parameters of importance detailed out in analysis.\nAnother factor is test taking environment at centre. Test series which only provide tests to be taken from home and no centre based tests should be generally avoided. No matter how much you try, the real feel of a test taking environment is only at the centre when you see so many other people also appearing for the test.\nAlso, the duration for declaring the results, how long does it take for the results and analysis to be available. (within 2-3 days is great and should be preferred)\nI will share how my experience has been with the AIMCAT series of TIME institute and rate them on parameters above. I am sorry I can't make an objective comparison as I don't have experience of appearing for other test series.\nNo. of people is 10k-20k, which is great. Moreover, the students are who are really serious about preparation, as most are enrolled in their classroom program also. 5/5 to AIMCAT for that.\nLevel is very high. Much higher than required to be. It should be difficult but not that difficult that the person develops a complex/fear from CAT and eventually drop out of preparation. Something which happens to may people I know, as they were not getting good scores in AIMCATs. 3/5\nAll topics covered in later AIMCATs. After July in fact. The initial ones missed out on some or the other topics. Also, each AIMCAT doesn't have all the topics, they might leave out on a few topics from a section in a particular AIMCAT. 3.5/5\nAnalysis available with detailed and video solution. 5/5 from me for this. This was really helpful. The topic wise analysis was great, with level of difficulty analysis and attempt %age, time taken.\nAlmost 1/3 AIMCATs are centre based. It should be increased to 50% at least. Also, centres are not adequate to accommodate everyone and there is a huge rush to select preferred centre before it gets filled. The worst part is if you don't get a test centre you can't appear for test at all. 3/5.\nInitially they used to take 1 week at least but gradually at the end they reduced to 3 days. So, 4/5 from me.\nOverall Score = 4/5\nI think I have given you an objective analysis. Please suggest me any other feature you think is important for a good test series and I will add that as well. Regarding the best, I am not the right person to talk about it.\nBut overall, you can join TIME test series and I don't think you will be disappointed.""]"
How should I start my preparations for the CAT 2019 if I am weak in maths?,8 Answers,['CAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I start my preparations for the CAT 2019 if I am weak in maths?'],"[""As a rule, there is no distinction in the procedure and on the center territory between such competitors and others. There is a high number of such understudies each year who figure out how to split the CAT, notwithstanding not being from a designing/measurements/maths/scientific science foundation. In 2017, three non-building understudies got 100 percentile score in CAT. From here, it is very obvious that on the off chance that you plan hard, you additionally have a reasonable opportunity to get 99 or more percentile score in CAT.\nOne should draw a limit among QA and maths. CAT requests just fundamental numerical aptitudes that we have learnt till class 10. CAT does not center around hypothetical thoughts but rather the use of essential ideas. This basically implies your insight into essential number-crunching and proportionality apparatuses, numbers, time speed remove, basic combinatorics, variable based math and geometry is all that could possibly be needed to enable you to split the test. The greater part of the issues present a dimension ground for everybody so there isn't a lot of leverage that engineers or other 'maths individuals' have. Most understudies escape and spotlight on 'exciting' ideas while dismissing more straightforward ones.\nFundamental scientific expertise is only one component of the QA segment and alternate measurements are more vital. These are the capacity to perform in a weight circumstance, perception expertise, basic leadership, versatility/adaptability lastly a capacity to understand the inquiries.\nTackling a CAT quant issue is a stepwise procedure and the fundamental calculation is\nStep-I: Comprehension of an inquiry,\nStep-II: Interpretation, that is, what is given and what is required et al.\nStep-III: Problem-unraveling (whenever required).\nPrior to moving to step-III, one ought to investigate every one of the conceivable outcomes of answer alternative disposal through different methodologies like perception or through discovering the scope of guesstimate esteems in the wake of dissecting the extraordinary cases.

CAT demands only basic mathematical skills that we have learnt till class 10. CAT does not focus on theoretical ideas but the application of basic concepts.\nThis essentially means that your knowledge of basic arithmetic and proportionality tools, numbers, time speed distance, elementary combinatorics, algebra and geometry is more than enough to help you crack the test.\nMost of the problems present a level ground for everyone so there isn’t much of an advantage that engineers or other ‘maths people’ have. Most students get carried away and focus on ‘glamorous’ concepts while neglecting simpler ones.\nBasic mathematical skill is just one dimension of the QA section and the other dimensions are more important. These are the ability to perform in a pressure situation, observation skill, decision making, adaptability/flexibility and finally an ability to comprehend the questions.\nSolving a CAT Quant problem is a step wise process and the basic algorithm is\nStep-I: Comprehension of a question,\nStep-II: Interpretation, that is, what is given and what is required.\nStep-III: Problem-solving (if required).\nBefore moving to step-III, one should explore all the possibilities of answer option elimination through various approaches like observation or through finding out the range of guesstimate values after analyzing the extreme cases. To inculcate the above set of skills, one needs to practice well.\nTime-bound practice will help the students to understand what concepts they require to revisit. Prepare a compendium of formulas topic-wise in a logical order. You need to also understand the restrictions, conditions, under which these are valid.\nPreparation tips :\n1. Learn the theory from first principles :\nMake a conscious effort to learn theory from basic ideas. We have a tendency to 'jump' steps when we get familiar with a topic. Resist the temptation to use plug-and-play formulae and learn the theory with an open mind.\n2. Do 'the grind' :\nDo lots of practice. Intuition is important, but the ability to power through lots of questions is extremely vital. Major portions of the processes should be on 'autopilot'. Fatigue is an important factor in CAT and it is nearly impossible to be switched on for 140 minutes continuously. When confronted with a tricky question, if you pick the right approach after may be 60 seconds of thinking, the remaining 100 seconds of actually solving the question should be done in mechanical fashion; in a manner that does not take much out of you.\nMore the processes on autopilot, the less tired you get, and therefore better the odds of 'cracking' the key idea behind the next question. To give a parallel, think about the time you tried to learn to drive a car (or ride a bike). In the first few instances, when the gear-clutch-brake mechanisms were still new, the experience would have been very tiring. Driving for even 30 minutes would have been exhausting. When the mind is processing that level of data, fatigue creeps in rapidly. But once you have done 200 kms on a vehicle, muscle-memory kicks in, the left hand and left leg move automatically, without having to be 'told'. Now, there is even bandwidth to speak on the phone while driving! Hands Free Please!\n3. Handle tougher questions by revisiting theory:\nOnce you have learnt from first principles and done the grind, you would have learnt all standard templates. Now the knowledge base is set, it is time build the ability to 'discover' newer frameworks. Ask more fundamental questions and work with proofs and properties."", 'Hi Shubham Gupta\nYou have ample amount of time and hence my advise would be to start from the very basic level.\nUse R.S.Aggarwal books for learning basic formulas and solving easy aptitude questions. After finishing this book, refer “Handa Ka Funda” online course to smoothly sail through this CAT preparation journey. This course will help you rewind to any topic anytime which in turn will be a great boon for you to recollect any concept whenever needed. It also teaches each and every topic right from the primary level which is a great boon for beginners and non-math students.\nFocus on your English and fundamental aptitude skills. The following are the primary actions you will have to take and work on religiously:\nPolish primary Grammar rules (Refer “High School Grammar by Wren and Martin” for practice)\nThe Articles – A, An, The\nParts of Speech\nSentence Construction\nModifiers\nSubject-Verb Agreement\nVerbs Tenses\nMake reading newspaper and novels part of your daily routine.\nSpend 40 mins for reading articles and editorials from newspapers like ‘The Hindu’, Economic Times, Mint, etc.\nRead a novel for an hour, refer to -Recommended Books and Novels List that every MBA / CAT Aspirant Should Read. While reading, make notes of important/difficult words with its meaning, synonyms antonyms. This will further build vocabulary extensively useful in solving RCs.\nUse the books by Nishit Sinha and CL for practice.\nSpend 2 hours daily and by the end of June you should have completed the learning and practice part sincerely.\nLater start taking sectional mocks by TIME. Identify the weaker areas and practice rigorously. After you feel content, switch to taking full-length mocks. After taking a mock, scrutinize it carefully to find the reasons behind your mistakes. This method is largely useful in preparing yourself for the best.\nTips:\nAt the beginning of preparation, solve 2 RC passages every day without fail.\nAfter completing the whole syllabus of CAT start solving 5 DI questions and 3–4 RC passages every day. Keep taking sectional mocks daily until you attain the confidence with respect to each section.\nSpend at least 2 hours for preparation even if you are occupied for the day.\nMake notes along with practicing questions daily. Any sort of idea or new shortcut should be part of these notes.\nA quick revision in the early morning of the previous day preparation. This works wonders!\nMake use of each and every day with sincerity and devotion, success will be definitely yours.\nHope this helps you. All the best!']"

Cat is all about aptitude unlike other entrance exams like GATE OR IES where knowledge also matters a lot.\nBut yes one thing I can assure you that if you start preparing before a year from the date of examination you would be able to do more practice and will be able to grasp the concepts pretty well.\nI started preparing for cat2015 in july 2015 after my btech and didn’t take any coaching.I used to study for atleast 5 hours a day and fortunately got 97 percentile.\nSo whatever be the way i.e self study or coaching you have to understand the concepts if you think you have sufficient amount of self motivation you can go for self preparation as well like i did.\nAnd since you have one year for the preparation you should practice as much as you can.\nSo better start today than tomorrow.\nGood luck :)', 'Frankly speaking, the earlier you start preparation, the better it is always.\nDon’t be misled by other people saying that they prepare everything just before a month or two.\nIf you want guaranteed success, then i suggest you these three things:-\n1.

The key being consistency over the period of your preparation.\nBest method of preparation Self Study/ Online Coaching : Nothing can beat self study.

If you looking for a comprehensive online preparation module, I would recommend you the visit iQuanta - Online CAT Coaching for MBA. They are offering the best online coaching in the market at a very inexpensive price. Do visit their facebook group Log into Facebook | Facebook, scores of problems are discussed 24X7 with never seen before approaches by their mentors.\nHappy Learning!', ""I would you give you the most detailed review of Iquanta and you decide yourself whether It is right for you or not. Going anonymous for obvious reasons\nIndrajeet Singh uses Facebook as a free platform to run Iquanta where He has made three separate secret groups each for QA, VARC and LRDI. Students are added in the respective group according to the course they pay for. Full Course fee is around 14k. Classes or I should say FB posts session is conducted from 10 pm to 12 am from Mon - Sat.\nThe strange thing is that for Rs. 14k you will only get FB posts. No study material. Indrajeet himself recommends that apart from iquanta you have to buy books (Sarvesh Sharma etc.), study material and Mocks of TIME / CL etc. Then why one should pay for his copy paste sessions.\nObviously for these mocks and books you have to pay separately.\nComing to QA, Classes are taken by Indrajeet himself. What he does is copy paste theory plus questions from other sources on internet or from his creativity and post it in the group just like a normal FB post. Nearly 100 people comment on that post writing answers and doubts. In that you have to find his comment where he gives solution and answer. Please dont expect him to reply 50 people in the comment section to solve their doubts. The intelligent people gives answers quickly and he is happy and moves on to further posts. This goes on for 2 hours. DONT EXPECT VIDEO TUTURIALS ETC. Coming to Live sessions which he boasts of, It comes only once or twice in a month or two as and when required for doubt clearing. Everything else is done in FB posts. Normally 15 questions are done in class and 10 given for assignment. Apart from that you have to do on your own.\nAbove image is a sample class screenshot. Now you decide yourself whether you can study like this or not.\nMoving ahead to LRDI, Classes are taken by Talha Khan, He posts a LRDI set containing multiple images which you cant see all at the same time because in FB you can see only 1 image at a time. So ques understanding and analysing becomes difficult. Then after 10 mins a youtube video is uploaded for that question in which he has already prepared solution beforehand and expects students to do the same when they see the question first time. I dont understand how do you expect students to solve such difficult problems when they cant see whole question in one place and just traversing through images. No doubt clearing session is there for LRDI. Questions and Solutions are posted and they call it a day.\nlastly if we talk about VARC, Classes are taken by Rudra Singh, In which 800 words passage is posted as a post followed by 5 longs questions with 5 options as well. Now I dont think any normal person can solve that by looking at a mobile and traversing the screen up and down. This is the approach which iquanta says is unique. Same goes with Parajumble and other type of questions.\nNow coming to main FB closed group - CAT PREPARATION - IQAUNTA, that is a very good platform which is free for all. Students post their doubts and other people try to help them.Since this group is run by Indrajeet himself he makes sure no body defames iquanta. He blocks that person and deletes his post. I have seen several people's comments who demanded refund as they expected a better course but they were blocked and refused for refund.\nDont go for these one sided reviews which he posts on main group so that other people also enroll in his classes.\nP.S. - To all those people who will be asking me who gave me authority to write such things, I would like to say that I was a student of Iquanta enrolled for full course. I studied in his fb sessions and trust me there is not a single trick he has told which is not there in any book.\nNow take your decision wisely. Good Luck""]"

You have 9-10 months for CAT 2016.\nFor the first few months you need to concentrate on the basics and practice some questions.  With your rotating shift job, you can try reading some book or solving Verbal Ability questions whenever you can either by downloading an App or reading from a book.  You need to figure out which among the 3 sections is the toughest for you and dedicate more time to it. In order to do this you can either,\nJoin a course online or you will find some websites which will teach you the basics for free.\nYoutube channels like Takshzila Shikshak have a wide range of  videos that cover all the topics in great detail. If you use  the Youtube app, take these videos offline and while you travel to work/ whenever you get time you can  watch them.\nRead blogs on CAT prep that have basics and shortcuts and logic explained.\nBuy a CAT preparation book and study.\nTry out each of these and choose what is best for you.\nOnce you have covered the basics solves as many practice questions and answer mocks as well.

Which online coaching institute is best for CAT Preparation?,100+ Answers,['CAT (Common Admission Test) 2016\nCAT Coaching\nCoaching Exams and Tests\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nCoaching\nWebsite Recommendations\nExams and Tests\nWhich online coaching institute is best for CAT Preparation?'],"[""There are multiple options to choose from and hence the decision can be perplexing. So let me share my experience with you hoping it would at least provide you some insight.\nI have been preparing for CAT for the past 2 years and enrolled in various classroom and online programs of reputed institutes such as CL and T.I.M.E. Now although they have had remarkable track records in the past and extremely experienced faculty I as a student realized that their teaching styles, methodologies and approach to questions is still in line with what an exam like CAT demanded a couple of years earlier. They weren’t able to cater to the changing needs of the Exam. Last year, mid way my preparation I realized that if I continued in the same manner it wouldn’t end well. Meanwhile , I came across a fairly new online preparation platform Elites Grid through my friend. They would conduct a few webinar classes for certain topics on minimal charges for everyone and I happened to enroll for a few classes. These were mostly QA classes conducted by Hunny Malhotra (QA 100%er and LRDI 99.6%er in CAT2017 ). I was surprised to see how much the previous courses lacked in terms of content and methodologies. I then followed them on FB page(Log into Facebook | Facebook) and checked their Youtube(YouTube) Channels. I learnt a lot of new concepts from them and all the methods taught in the free videos prompted me to enroll in their Booster classes. The questions discussed and the approaches that the faculties shared was extremely helpful in helping me build up different approaches to solving a question. Unfortunately, the scores I aimed for I wasn’t able to achieve. So this year from the very beginning I joined EG and in the past four months that I have been preparing with them I can see positive changes in myself.\nNow if you are skeptical about online platforms then let me tell you that the classes conducted are all live on WIZIQ. The faculties clarify our doubts not only just during the class but also after the classes. They are always available to clarify your doubts. Apart from that there are FB groups where you can post your queries and our peers also also help us in clarifying our doubts.\nTake a look at what the Regular course offers -\nFeatures -\n1) Live Webinar Sessions\n2) Live Assignment discussion sessions\n3) Recorded sessions of all the classes of students dashboard\n4) 24*7 Support (Facebook + Website) Till xat 2019\n5) 5 Sessions in a week + 2 Practice Sessions\n6) They will distribute and post the relevant study material (comprising of original questions at the start of every week and for the rest of the week they will have regular sessions on the same topic. On weekends they will conduct extended sessions where they will be helping everyone with any doubts one might have or any further discussions.\n7) The idea is to start from the most basic topics and cover the entire curriculum way before time so one can have more time for revision and mock tests.\n8) First and foremost, they will be providing the students with study material every week on a certain topic, and for the rest of the week, they will discuss on the various strategies to encounter such problems. To further help the students, they will be classifying the problems in five levels:\nLevel 1: Greenhorn\nLevel 2: Moderate\nLevel 3: Veteran\nLevel 4: Doyen\nLevel 5: Brutal\nAn analysis of past year papers is sufficient to determine that the difficulty of CAT will not be beyond Level 4, however, they believe in preparing the students for the worst case scenario and thus have included a difficulty level that goes over and above to what is asked in CAT and XAT.\nThe problems provided will be a mix of both original problems prepared by their dedicated staff and actual exam questions. Detailed discussion sessions will be held to clear the students' doubts.\nThey further believe that cracking Section 2 requires a lot of practice; hence students will be provided with some good level of sets every day that they will be required to solve in a timed manner.\nAnd to improve reading skills and comprehension, an article is posted daily, and discussions are held on the same.\nAnd to further help the students determine their position and to promote healthy competition, they also conduct daily sectional tests\nREVIEWS & RESULT OF 2016 Batch\n1- https://goo.gl/STpJ2z\n2- https://goo.gl/u8cXMH\n3- https://goo.gl/Acp2Nd\n4- https://goo.gl/g7GrTc\nIIFT RESULT - https://goo.gl/RwegV3\nCAT RESULT- https://goo.gl/bj8Cxc\nNMAT RESULT- 20+ scored more than 220\nCAT 2017 Reviews in this link by CAT 2017 Batch Students\nhttps://goo.gl/DKSRwb\nResult of 2017 Batch till now\n1) 27 Students are selected for IIFT interview till now\n2) 35 Students scored more than 215 in NMAT till now (Exactly not counted till now because calls are still pending)\n3) CAT Result - 1) Quant Resut- https://goo.gl/dgBkLB\n2) Complete Result- https://goo.gl/ehDnG9\n4) Reviews by 1st Batch Students- https://goo.gl/t6Ln3u\nWHY ELITESGRID - https://goo.gl/9XV7hg\nI hope this helps you in getting some insight and if you happen to join us at Elites Grid then we will be all delighted to welcome you then. :)"", 'First you all I’d suggest you have a look at CAT 2017 and analyze your strong and weak zones and then go ahead with the preps plan. This will help you in deciding whether you need individual subjects like VARC or DILR or the package of all the subjects.\nVerbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC)\nIn my opinion Reading Comprehension (RC) comprises of 24% of the question paper, so you must ace RC. For this, you can opt for Wordpandit’s Ultimate RC course, which has the wide range of plans and variety with super talented support faculty. It gives you the detailed video of RC, grammar, and verbal ability along with facebook lives sessions and WhatsApp support. And the most beautiful part of this course is its Daily Reads followed by doubt clearing session, which expose you to diverse and intense reading required for CAT.\nData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DI&LR) and Quantitative Aptitude (QA)\nDILR has been the Achilles heel for most of the CAT aspirants, while QA has been on the easier side for last 2–3 years. For these two subjects, you can go with CL’ s online classes. It has a team of prolific faculties like Gautam Puri and Gijo, who are one of the best in their respective field. Basically, this package provides assistance with all the subjects including VARC, but while preparing I felt Wordpandit for VARC has an edge.\nMock test series\nFor mock CAT you can choose either CL or IMS, but I felt CL’s mock was closer to the actual CAT and its test analysis provide great insights, which actually helps tremendously in preparing the right strategy for taking CAT.\nHope this will help.\nGood Luck for CAT- 2018.\nFor CAT 2017 question paper: https://www.handakafunda.com/wp-...\nhttps://www.handakafunda.com/wp-...\nWordpandit RC course: https://learn.wordpandit.com/?re...\nCL’s CAT Cracker: Smart CAT Cracker- CAT Online prep, CAT elearning', 'Hello there,\nLet me tell you about iQuanta for you to nail your CAT exam preparation. Read the answer completely for all the features of iQuanta.\nWhat is iQuanta and who is Indrajeet?\niQuanta is basically an organization that specializes in MBA Exam preparations.\nIt was started by a person named Indrajeet Singh who had come up with a lot of unconventional techniques and shortcuts during his CAT preparation and did not want it to lay waste with him. Therefore, he started helping students prepare for CAT and this grew strong and wild all-around India and the world.\nBut you may ask this common question: Why iQuanta?\nCost: iQuanta wants to make the students journey as smooth as possible and does not want cost to be a major barrier. Hence, its fees when compared to other organisations its fees is nearly half of its competitors.\nContent: Once joining a course, all the classes happen in their private Facebook group-https://www.facebook.com/groups/.... iQuanta chooses teachers only who have an expertise and extensive grip in their hand respective fields. Even the founder (Indrajeet Singh) takes part in the teaching process. Basic point: You get to learn from the BEST of the BEST teachers for your CAT preparations. iQuanta covers all your portions in 4-5 months and rest of the time will be dealt with dealing with tricks, shortcuts and clearing the innumerable doubts one has almost immediately (More on that in the upcoming points).\nConvenience: Whoever you may be, whichever job you may choose to be in, whatever you are studying, one of the major things that happen when you want to prepare for the exams is that of the time constraint. Let’s say a person named Alice wants to prepare for CAT, but she also has a job from 9-7 every day. Alice has spent her energy already after the day and cannot travel such long distances. If you can relate to Alice or you are a student going to a college all day, then iQuanta has the perfect class schedule for you. The classes happen in a private group(https://www.facebook.com/groups/...) at 10pm every day.This is convenient for reasons\nWork or college will not be there.\nThose who travel will normally come back home by 10pm.\nBy 10pm, normally you are well rested and there you are not in rush for class, you are peaceful.\n10pm is still not possible for you? No problem, you can always watch the lectures later after the class is done\n4.Tricks and shortcuts: iQuanta provides a lot of tricks and shortcuts for acing the exams , also when the teachers solve the doubts i the group, one can get to know how they solve it and you can see it again and again as it will be in the group itself.A lot of students who have gone to various colleges from this institute have commented that the tricks were very helpful in their way to ace their dream college.\n5.Doubt Clarification: iQuanta is probably the best when it comes to ending your doubts:\na) One can post a doubt in the fb group and get that doubt cleared in minutes by an expert in that subject.\nb) Once you enrol in a course, faculty details are given along with a WhatsApp group where you can ask you faculty all the doubts you encounter.\nc) Others can also learn by seeing what your doubt was and the expert opinion based on it.\n6. Community: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Rockthecat. This link will lead you to a group where you can see that there are on average 160 posts every day of the week. This group is very active and hence you can feel that there is a lot of active preparation material going on in this group.\nThe page has an outstanding 275,629 people as of now and is growing. Having a good and huge nurturing environment is essential to crack the exam and iQuanta provides this with ease.\n7.Results:The training of iQuanta is evident from the results they provide. The results are as follows:\na) 100+ students got into category-1 B schools\nb) 120 students made into IIMs (CAT 17 batch)\nc) 40 converts from IIM A,B,C,L and XLRI alone\nd) 17 questions came directly in CAT2017\nIf you want to crunch numbers:\ne) In CAT 15: 100+ got 95% and above, 17 people got 99.6% and above, and 35 IIFT calls\nf) In CAT 16: 44 students secured 99%, 80 people got 98%, and 70 IIFT calls\ng) In CAT 17: 45+ students secured 99%, 100+ students got 97% and above.\nConclusion: If you want to join an online institute please consider the points i have jotted above and take the next step. Any institute is fine if it satisfies your criteria ,this is just my suggestion and you can choose freely to join whichever institute you want.\nThank you for reading the answer :)\nPS:Here are some testimonials\nResources for the answer:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/Rockthecat\nhttps://iquanta.in/cat-online-co...\nMy opinion :)', 'Hey there!\nCAT is the most popular MBA entrance exam conducted by the IIMs to get through the most premier management institutes of the country and we all know it’s not at all easy to get one.

If you can give then give those notes to him/her. The day you will clear the exam, you will feel good that you did good with others so good happened with you as well :)\nStill, if you don’t want to give notes to your friend then, instead of notes, you give some really heavy books (may be 700 pages or more) and say from these books I use to practice and ask him/her to return within two days as these are not yours but of your elder sibling/cousin. The heavy book will be difficult to get xeroxed and easy to get a new one :)\nGood luck!!!!', 'You are feeling uncomfortable bcaus u feel that u have paid a lot of money and he is getting all these things free of cost.

How can I prepare for GRE and CAT simultaneously?,10 Answers,['Study Strategies\nCAT Preparation\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nAcademic and Educational Advice\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow can I prepare for GRE and CAT simultaneously?'],"['Let me tell you what skills both GRE and CAT measures and you can decide on your own about which will be more competitive for you or which is more suitable for you. In Graduate Record Examination(GRE)\nThe Verbal Reasoning section measures your ability to analyze and draw conclusions from discourse, understand multiple levels of meaning, select important points and understand the meanings of sentences and entire texts.\nThe Quantitative Reasoning section measures your ability to interpret and analyze quantitative information and use mathematical skills such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, probability and statistics to solve problems.\nThe Analytical Writing section measures your ability to sustain a well-focused, coherent discussion, articulate complex ideas clearly and effectively, support your ideas with relevant examples and examine claims and accompanying evidence.\nWhere in CAT,\nQuantitative Ability part is separated into four modules: Arithmetic, Modern math, Algebra, Geometry. Each of these has a strong reflection of managerial quotient. Arithmetic is heavy on the numbers where the questions are best attempted by understanding the underlying symmetry and patterns, thus stressing on this skill as a potent managerial strength; Algebra is based on equations, which measure the candidate’s ability to understand variables and correlate them into meaningful relationships, thus emphasizing upon a candidate’s ability to extend this skill to similar situations in management; Geometry is based on understanding space which is analogous to conceptualizing the market space and handling challenges like product positioning; Modern Math explores multiple possibilities implicit in a situation thus testing a candidate on lateral thinking – one of the most powerful tools for innovation and idea generation in the business world.\nData Interpretation checks the data processing and comprehension abilities of a candidate. Questions are based on bar graphs, line graphs, data tables, pie charts and other related statistical tools. The management angle is manifested in the fact that managers analyze huge chunks of data on a regular, daily basis and base their decisions on these data bytes.\nLogical Reasoning questions in the CAT measure the application of logic in different situations like arrangements, coding -decoding etc. Proficiency in handling these questions is indicative of a higher logical quotient which is a huge facilitator in successful handling of management challenges.\nVerbal Ability comprises of questions on areas like Usage & Grammar, Verbal Reasoning and Reading Comprehension. Usage & Grammar includes questions on antonyms, synonyms, analogies, fill in the blanks, etc. – each testing a certain managerial skill. For example, questions on fill in the blanks measure a candidate’s contextual competence, which is a preferred managerial trait.', ""Absolutely.\nActually it's a very logical decision. They test you on the same things. LOD of Verbal in GRE > LOD of Verbal in CAT.\nLOD of QADI in CAT > LOD of QADI in GRE.\n\nThus, they will be mutually beneficial as well."", 'The syllabus of GRE and CAT overlaps.

How can I start my CAT prep for 2018?,18 Answers,['CAT Preparation 2018\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow can I start my CAT prep for 2018?'],"['Quantitative Aptitude: Go through entire NCERT class 10th book within 20 days. Entire book should be covered. I am assuming that you are willing to join an institute. First of all solve the funda-books and class sheets provided by institute with best of you ability, and by as many methods as possible. Then solve previous year’s actual papers.\nAdditional helps:\nJoin facebook groups. If u have ample time, pick a good side book for QA (but only after completing class sheets and previous papers)\nLogical Reasoning and Data Interpretation: Pick the fundabook and class sheets provided by your institute and go through it deeply. Firstly, make your fundamentals strong (within 2 months) and then try to solve harder LRDI sets provided by your institute or from a good LRDI side book. Then, finally, all the previous year,s CAT questions.\nVerbal Ability and Reading Comprehension:Please please please… read all the English books from class 8th to class 12th. You can also read History, Economics, Political Science books of class 8th, 9th and 10th so that if a passage appears on History, Economics or Political Science, it will be easy for you to interpret that passage perfectly (this must be done within 2 months). THENNNN… it will be the time for you to know about verbal logic i.e. critical thinking (this must be done within 1 month). Nowwww…main part…start RC with level 1 passages, then increase the level of the passages.\nYou can take the help of internet\nFor QA, visit these YouTube channels: Career Launcher, HitBullsEye, 2IIMCAT, Amiya Kumar, Anil Nair, PT Education, Brilliant.org etc.\nFor LRDI, visit there YouTube channels: Mind Your Decision, Riddles and Puzzles.\nAlso solve the puzzle book by George J. Summers.\nFor VARC, there are many websites and YouTube channels.\naldaily.com, rcprep.com, MIT critical reasoning (YouTube), Oxford University critical reasoning by M. Talbot (YouTube).\nThank u!', 'Start by starting! It is a lot like learning how to swim.\nYou can refer to hundreds of books and videos on ‘how to swim’ but you need to take that dive to start learning!\nTake that dive - take a mock!\nMore specifically, these are some pointers you could refer to for starting your cAT Preparation:\nTest the waters - Try your hand at a few mocks, take out some questions from online sources and take your sweet time to solve them. Try to hit as many as 30 topics from QA and LRDI, and try your hand at the Verbal section as well. After this exercise, you will know where you stand - strengths and weaknesses. You can take a look at CATKing Mock Series to start with.\nTheory for weaknesses, shortcuts for strengths- All your efforts should now be focused on learning theories and concepts to clear out doubts in weak areas, and finding shortcuts and tricks to save time on your strong areas. Test each theory/shortcut you are learning with a mock.\n\nLittle by little, bring your weaknesses to your strengths side, and your strengths to super strengths.\nDeep analysis of mocks - Even though you were already analysing mocks, this stage will require careful analysis of sequencing of answering questions, the logic behind right answers, the logic behind wrong answers and determining how you could have approached the exam better. Question-by-question analysis is just short-term correction, look at the overall exam to find out what you could have done better. Leaving questions is a niche art, master it.\nLastly, I would suggest you to attend this free CAT Workshop. But remember, the sooner you dive in, the faster you’ll learn! Good luck.', 'Well the answer depends on whether you have appeared earlier in the exam or not.\nFor freshers:\n1)VARC-start reading novels/newspaper editorials or few online websites on a daily basis.There are 3 main question types that you need to focus upon:\na)Reading comprehension(RCs)-You can’t crack CAT until you have a strong hold on this section. For initial stage read diverse subjects and try to comprehend what the author wants to convey. Then start practicing from books of any coaching material. I would suggest TIME.Also take sectional tests.\nb)summary and para completion-Relatively the easiest part of VARC section where you should have very high accuracy.Practice frm same coaching material and take sectional tests.The options may not be accurate but you need to select the relatively most accurate option.\nc)Para jumbled and odd one out-odd one out is again an easy part but para jumbled is one of the difficult parts of CAT since there are no options given. You need to have enough practice of reading and solving these questions to get them correct but I would suggest to leave them anyway.\nOverall VARC is one of the most scoring sections in CAT as the paragraphs are not very hard to comprehend. The only problem is the options which are too close and one should be very good at elimination.\n2)LRDI-Most of the people find this section difficult but I never faced such issue. I will discuss my strategy. Hopefully it will help. There is no separate strategy for LR and DI. If there is a proper DI question with no logic required(Data based) solve it right away because you don’t need to solve all the questions in DI. just try to solve 4 sets out of the 8. Then try to solve the LR which is your strength(Sudoku type for me) or try to find out that LR where the option is NOT Cannot be determined.Try to utilize first 10 mins to find the sets which you have to solve and spend rest 50 mins on solving. Solve at least 4 and at max 6 which can fetch u 100 percentile. If you don’t find any relevant material solve previous mock papers as they are the best source one can get.\n3)QA-The section which is the favorite of all engineers. There can be two strategies.\na)Learn shortcuts- There are shortcuts for most of the questions. If you know the shortcuts you can reduce time on few questions and utilize it for other questions. One should be able to easily solve 25+ questions/34 in CAT as per the standard of CAT 2017.\nb)gain speed via practice- Practice so much that you know the approach of most of the questions. If you know the approach you will not find any new question in the CAT exam and even if you don’t know the shortcut, if you know how to solve that question, you can solve sufficient number of questions with almost 100 percent accuracy.\nFor those who have already appeared once:\nYou people know your strengths and weakness.Work on your weakness and never forget your strengths. Your strength is going to take you to the target.Manage both. Start taking mocks as soon as possible because you already know the syllabus.\nHope it helps.', ""Preparation Strategy\nThere are no hard and fast rules that one can crack CAT if they start preparation very early. Some of them with just 2 months of rigorous preparation have been able to pull it off. Yes indeed. If you start early, you will have lots of time and can prepare with ease. If not, then it could be pretty strenuous but still you can pull it off provided that you have the sheer determination to do it so.\nFocus on the Basics/Fundamentals.\nThen increase the pace and also the level of your preparation.\nI have explained some simple strategies which you can effectively follow;\nSimple strategies but could prove to be very effective:\nPlease follow 20 mins strategy. Prepare seriously for 20 mins and then give a small break. Break depends as you can take a 1 min break to an hour. It solely boils down to you. With this strategy, even if you prepare for 10 times a day (10 x 20 mins = 200 mins = 3hrs 20 mins); then you would be able to put in 3hrs and 20 mins of valuable effort. More importantly, you will not have any starting problem as some students struggle to even start.\nFurther, keep yourself fit by doing meditation, yoga and exercises like walking, running etc to keep yourself fit. Staying fit helps you in enhancing the body & mind and in turn helps in increasing the concentration level.\nHave a clear goal for your preparation. Work everyday with a plan. Systematic and consistent preparation helps you a lot. More importantly, learn it with passion. If you learn with passion, then you can enjoy studying and not creating self inflicted unwanted stress.\nClear Plan and Goal\nI come across students at times who say that they want to do this and that and so on. Have a clear plan, stick onto your goal and learn with passion. You can then achieve what you want.\nSelf Study or Joining Online/Classroom Coaching\nOne always has an option to go in for self study. But that requires a high level of self motivation, sheer hard work and lots of time to understand the concepts.\nIn turn, if you join coaching institute, it really helps you as you get to learn from the expert faculty in respective areas and it helps you to save a lot of time, as understanding concepts can take time. Further, you tend to learn tips, strategies and short cuts from the faculties.\nFurther for preparation, student can choose online coaching. But then, the rigor of online and classroom coaching definitely differs. Coaching institutes play an important role in imparting strategies and giving a systematic structure to the student.\nOther than this, student should be sincere to classes and must put the best effort as their is no substitute for hard work.\nFactors to be Considered for Classroom Coaching\nIf someone has to choose coaching institute, then the factors to be considered are\n1) Faculty profiles (that also include qualifications) [In my opinion, that's one of the most important factor],\n2) Small class size i.e Faculty : Student Ratio (Even this is a very important factor) [It is still fine if the class size is slightly large provided that very good faculties handle the class]\n3) Materials,\n4) Online Test Series (Since most of the exams are online),\n5) Training for Written Ability Test & Personal Interview,\n6) Post Counselling [To help students to choose the best of the B-Schools]\nOnline test series, training for interviews, post counselling etc will be missing if you were to prepare on your own. It’s not how early you start or you prepare in a rush with few months to go, the most important thing is that you enjoy the journey & learn it with passion and work hard with clear goal of getting into the top B-Schools no matter what.\nTake Mock Tests\nFurther, take lots of Mock Tests (after your preparation) and do a lot of self analysis after each and every test. Through this, you would be able to analyze your strengths and weakness. More importantly, you will not repeat the same mistakes again.\nNOTE: SIGN Consulting has created a mark in the field of CAT Coaching because of it’s rigor and for the individual attention given to each & every student.

What should be the study plan for CAT16 from May 2016 onwards?,8 Answers,['CAT Preparation 2016\nExam and Test Studying Strategies\nStudy Habits\nCAT Preparation\nExam and Test Preparation\nStudying\nExams and Tests\nWhat should be the study plan for CAT16 from May 2016 onwards?'],"[""Honestly, it is no biggie. You will be tested on your quants and verbal skills. Quants includes basic math. There is no higher level math such as calculus. As for the verbal section, it tests your grammar and reading skills. You can do the entire prep for 2 months and still get a good percentile. However, what really is important is to take as many mock tests as you can. CAT is all about the number of questions you get right within the allotted time. It is fairly easy to solve the entire paper without setting a time limit. The paper will have difficult questions. But at the same time, a fair share of easy and moderate ones. The key is to choose the right questions. The reason I'm stressing on mocks is because you'll get to experiment with the sections. Once you do that, you'll figure out a strategy that works for you. For concepts, I strongly recommend TIME institute’s videos. It costs about Rs.3000 and it is really worth the price. So once you go through the basics, do a lot of full length tests. Also, analyze them. You should be fine. All the best. :)"", 'Hello\nFirst of all if you are giving CAT for first time i would suggest you to solve 1 or 2 past CAT paper .On the basis of that you can know about your speed ,accuracy,your strong and weak points.\nAs you are starting from MAY ,this is the best possible time to start the preparation .\nAfter step 1 or if you are a retaker you would know your areas of strength and weakness .You could write it down on excel sheet your strong and weak areas ,you can mark strong areas as green and weak areas as red .You should daily put in 2-3 hrs of preparation in weak areas starting from May 16 till july 16 .Also you could do few problem of your strong areas to stay in touch with topic you know .\nIn the month of July you could enroll for mock test series ,as a fresher CL is good option.Also Handa ka Funda is a good option.The link is here-Online Coaching for CAT and Banking Exams You can attend a free session there to know more about it.\nYou can start with 1-2 mocks per week from July till October .Then increase it to 2-3 Mocks per week.

How can I improve my percentile in CAT 2017?,4 Answers,['CAT 2017 Books\nCat 2017 Aspirant\nCAT Preparation 2017\nCAT (Common Admission Test) 2017\nPercentile\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExams and Tests\nHow can I improve my percentile in CAT 2017?'],"['In order to do that, you first need to improve your scores in CAT 17 Mocks. Let me tell you one major reason why students are not able to improve their mock scores.\nProblem Area:\nNo time bound practice: Students prepare and practice questions from various sources, however they have the luxury of time when they are practicing. However, they have to get a score in mocks in a time bound manner. This is the root cause of the problem, why students are not able to improve their scores.\nSolution:\nWhen you have analyzed a particular mock and found out your weak areas. Firstly, go back to the basics and practice questions on those areas. Once you have revised your basics, then pick up CAT level questions on those areas and practice them in a time bound manner. Make sure the ratio of questions to time limit is same as that you get in CAT Exam. This you are well prepared for next mock.\nApply this technique, you will surely be able to improve your mock scores.\nFor Mumbai CAT 17 Aspirants, MBAP is Coming Up with their FREE Final Lap To CAT Workshop on 5th Nov. This will help you increase your scores by 20.\nFollow MBAP Facebook Page: MBAP - Abhijeet Singh\nWebsite: www.mbapathshala.com\nRegards,\nHaider Aabidi\nMBAP - Founder', ""I am in the same boat and have a similar score(93.39).\nBut, I won't go for CAT2017.\nReasons:\nCAT is unpredictable. You might end up scoring 99+ or your score might drop. The marking scheme is relative which adds to the unpredictability of the exam.\nScore isn't all what you need. You need a stellar profile(Work ex preferred) and good GD-PI to get selected.\nStill, if you're confident that you can score better this year then you must go for CAT2017.\nComing to the main part of the question, enrol for TIME and CL mocks and try to identify your weak and strong areas.\nImprove your reading speed. I would suggest you to read editorial page of The Hindu.\nFor LR DI, solve as many sets as possible from previous year mocks and CAT papers available online.\nBest of Luck."", 'About improving the Percentile in CAT 2017\nSince you have already given it once in 2016, you know where you are weak and where you are strong and also you have the basics in place- thus the general suggestion\nFocus on getting the weak parts up-to par while keeping the strong sections strong if not making them stronger\nBest way to do is of course- to keep practicing (time and effort - no other easy way)- and MOST IMPORTANTLY to give the MOCK Exams be it AIMCATs or any other online mock examinations (provided there are enough students giving the mock exams so you know where you stand) - This is particularly important since the nature of the exam is not score based but a percentile based exam and sometimes we tend to forget that.\nWhat will improve your scores is what you do post giving the mock exams - which is the analysis of the questions types and the time allocation to each and whether you are able to identify the easy/moderate/difficult questions and how you are bale to tackle that.\nAbout joining the NGO and not finding time to study\nThis comes down to time management and I am sure you would have heard it before or rather you know it. But it really really is the only solution. You must find an hour/even half hour a day and it will go a long way.\nAlso i am not sure what motivates you but if you are of the opinion that “if someone else can do it why not you” then this is the perfect application of that. There are a lot and i mean lots of people who work 14–16 hrs day in their jobs and crack CAT.\nFocus is key.\nDO NOT find someone to sympathize with you where you are justifying the fact that you are unable to study because of the time and someone is reinforcing that belief. This really is the time to invest in yourself and only you can find the solution to this.\nYou may use the Weekends, gaps in weekdays where you are home early, public holidays etc. upto you\nAbout joining the NGO to cover the gap\nThere is no right or wrong choice for this. But in reality there are two scenarios that can happen post CAT 2015\nYou get calls to the IIMs and proceed to the interviews - There the chances of this coming up is pretty high - and it should really be fine as long as you are able to justify the choice and also show that you have made some impact (which will help when they ask you “what did you do the last year?”\nsomething goes wrong and you do not get a call / you do not clear the interview - I don’t mean to discourage you at all but i am just laying down a possible scenario. In that case you need to be ok with the place you are at so that it doesn’t bother you in case you don’t make it this year or if you have an exit plan then it is also fine. This matters ONLY if you have absolutely no interest in the NGO whatsoever and ONLY doing it for the workex such that staying in it even for a second more that what is required will eat you away', 'To be honest 92 percentile is quite good, however with a bit of smart and systematic approach this percentile can easily surge to 98. In order to improve your percentile you first need to understand your strengths and weakness which can be understood by giving mocks and doing their detailed analysis. To know how to do detailed analysis read this - An interesting relationship between CAT Percentile and Mock Scores\nFor smart preparation I would recommend you go through these links. These are completely free and would save your valuable time.\nQuant Link - Best Quant Preparation Videos, Articles and Practice Questions for MBA exams.\nVerbal Link - Best VA Preparation Videos, Articles and Practice Questions for MBA exams.\nNow coming down to the second part of the question on wither you should join an NGO or not. It totally depends on what you want to do in live. If you see your future in NGO’s, then go ahead and join it. However joining NGO to cover gap isn’t the best option. In case you have decided to choose this option get ready to be grilled during interviews- For eg: Will you again join an NGO after completing your MBA? If you want to, how will MBA help in that purpose?\nThe final choice lies on your wise wisdom. If I were at your place, I would have joined NGO as a weekend hobby.\nAll the best for your preparation.']"

If you can give then give those notes to him/her. The day you will clear the exam, you will feel good that you did good with others so good happened with you as well :)\nStill, if you don’t want to give notes to your friend then, instead of notes, you give some really heavy books (may be 700 pages or more) and say from these books I use to practice and ask him/her to return within two days as these are not yours but of your elder sibling/cousin.

Why do cat experts say not to punish a cat as they can't remember anything; yet they hide in the bedroom after tearing through the trash?,6 Answers,"[""Cat Litter Boxes\nDog Training\nCat Behavior\nDog Behavior\nAnimal Behavior\nCAT Preparation\nCats (domestic)\nDogs (pets)\nPets\nAnimals\nPsychology of Everyday Life\nPhilosophy of Everyday Life\nWhy do cat experts say not to punish a cat as they can't remember anything; yet they hide in the bedroom after tearing through the trash?""]","['Here’s the deal. Cats, just like dogs, will only associate being told no, or punished to stop behavior you don’t like if you catch them in the act of doing something wrong. There are things you can do to stop cats (and dogs) from getting in the trash, but my advice is to get covered trash cans. Punishments for cats should be no more harsh than a firm “NO!”, or being squirted with water. With kittens and very bad behavior I have gently grabbed the scruff of the neck and shaken them lightly (not in the air) because this is how mom cat used to discipline them. There are lots of creative ways you can make bad behaviors less rewarding for cats. (Counter surfing, garbage fishing, curtain climbing, sharpening claws on the furniture instead of the cat post and MORE. ) Google it. Punishing any animal after the fact is a waste of time, and just leads them to fear you. Yes, they are hiding because they are reading your body language and scent, and know you are not happy. Some dogs might know they’ve done something wrong, but punishing them after the fact isn’t going to stop the behavior either. As someone else said, animals live in the moment. I will voice my displeasure with a dog when I come home to mayhem and destruction. “Who did this? Someone was so BAD!” Cats are just going to hide, or wash. Because they don’t really care if you rant and rave. Trust me on this.', 'She’s hiding from you because she senses anger and she’s afraid of you. She has no clue what it’s about.\nCats don’t make complicated mental connections. If you yell at her when she is doing something, it may make her not want to do that thing again. If you yell at her five minutes later—even one minute later— she won’t have a clue why you are doing that. She doesn’t have the reasoning capacity to follow the chain of cause and effect to make sense of it. (Neither does a child, necessarily, but when we punish a child we tell him why we are doing it.) You are just a scary person who yells at her.', 'Its not that they can’t remember, its that unless you say NO right while they’re doing something, they only know what it is you don’t like. Cats are in the here and now, and they associate/connect certain things with certain actions, that’s how they’re hard-wired. Have you ever been scolded and not known what you’ve done wrong because you’re not doing it right then? Cats are like that; they connect food with the sound of a can being opened; they see you bring out the carrier and they know its for a trip to the vet (good luck in catching your cat then!', 'I think the not remembering part is wrong. At least in the situations where they are caught in the act or immediately after the act, my cats clearly know what they have done.\nThe problem is they are usually seeking attention. Good, bad -- doesn\'t matter. If you punish them, by whatever means, you are giving them attention and thus reinforcing the behavior.\nThat\'s why whenever possible I ignore the bad behavior. I will usually take steps to prevent a recurrence of it, but I resist overt punishments. Although there is nothing that my cats hate more than being ignored, so in a way, they actually are being punished.\nMy one exception, and it goes against expert advice, is the squirt gun. The experts say this can damage your cat\'s psyche and never to use it, but I keep one around for “emergencies"". If, for example, the cat has jumped on the stove and it has a burner on, I will squirt them down.\nI\'d rather risk damaging their psyches (although for the record this does not appear to be a problem) than see them physically hurt.\nSusy exploring the cat superhighway.']"

How should I start my preparation for CAT-2019?,69 Answers,['CAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I start my preparation for CAT-2019?'],"['Hello Folks!\nThanks for A2A\nAs you have more than one year for CAT-19 preparation, you should make sure that you make a very strong platform to nail the exam! It is in mastering basics that the key to CAT prep lies.\nSo, how to prepare?\nBefore starting your preparation, go through the syllabus and exam pattern once. The syllabus is divided into three sections-\nVerbal Ability and reading comprehension\nData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning\nQuantitative Ability\nRevising your basics well is the most important part of your preparation. Only after you clear your concepts, you can do well in CAT. Complete the basics(chapter wise). Most CAT chapters are from your high school syllabus(class 8–9–10). Revise them all properly. Additionally, do lots of CAT relevant reading; daily newspaper(The Hindu, Economic Times, NYT etc.), magazines or any random articles on philosophy and psychology from wikipedia. You can also read non fiction novels and follow management blogs to nourish your reading habit. This will help you a lot in building higher speed and comprehension for CAT. You should also build good puzzle habits! Solve crossword and sudoku from a good English daily on a regular basis. This will sharpen your mind for CAT.\nYour motive should be to revise the concepts and to overcome the fear of certain topics if you had them during your school days. Some students never liked Geometry in school; some were never good in reading; some had issues with permutation combination - These issues need to be tackled first. Get over your fears in the first 4–5 months of your CAT 2019 preparation. This is the key to gaining confidence and also to perfect competition. A good CAT learning module with CAT experts can help here.\nPost covering your basics, your focus should shift on learning the best methods to solving CAT level questions. At my coaching (Bfactory), we focus on these major aspects:\n1. Value putting\n2. Option elimination\n3. Speed reading\n4.Structuring of information\n5.Shortcut methods\nYou should try to think faster and sharper than before.\n6–7 months before CAT, start giving topic and sectional tests and solve advance level questions as many as you can. Be disciplined in your efforts and you will feel the change in your aptitude levels by this time!\nGive your last few months in giving full mocks and do complete analysis of your mocks. Analysis of mocks will help you point out your weaker sections and the areas where you do silly mistakes. Once you know your weak areas your task is to work upon them to convert them into your strong areas. Practice more questions until you excel in those topics. Testing makes perfect in a competition.\nCAT preparation is like a Marathon; start well and keep moving! Make sure you finish well!\nKamlesh Sir(IIM Ahmedabad) and I are in Delhi for a CAT meet up(informal career chat over coffee at CCD, Connaught Place) on 14th July. If you want to meet up and discuss CAT prep, click on this link:\nInvitations, Free eCards and Party Planning Ideas from Evite\nHappy learning!\nRahul Sir\nCAT Coach\nwww.bfactory.in', 'CAT is generally conducted on last Sunday of November. So it is safe to say there are 50 weeks for CAT-2019. The time is sufficient for anyone to prepare for CAT and get excellent score, provided he/she is dedicated and ready to work hard. People with good basics would be having an obvious advantage. Those who are not good with basics can bridge the gap given the time for CAT-2019.\nLet’s discuss how should one approach for CAT-2019. We can briefly divide preparation in 2 parts- one is actual CAT exam and profile.\n1.Profile-\nYour profile consists of your curricular and extra-curricular achievements, your hobbies, interests and expertise if any. Your 10th/12th/grad score are important. If you have a good score there it gives you an edge. In case if they are not too great, there are many thing that can be done for building your profile. You can’t go back to change those scores so don’t waste your time worrying about it. Do various certifications(related to your field of interest can be preferred), social work, have a hobby/field of interest. It can be anything so find what you are interested in. Work Experience is also important part of your profile.\n2. Actual CAT-\nFrom past 3 years the pattern of CAT is almost same. So it is safe to assume that there won’t be any major changes next year too. But keep yourself prepared for various situations. We can say there will be 3 sections again.\n1.VARC(34 questions)- VARC or English section is generally said to be easy or moderate section. But it is important that you score as many marks as you can in this section.\nRC- Out of those 34 questions 24 questions are asked on RCs. There are 5 passages in total having length of roughly around 650–700 words. Trust me, you won’t need reading speed of 220/250 wpm, If you read the passage in 5 mins and answer questions in next 5–6 mins, that is sufficient. For that start reading. Read good news papers then move on to better ones. Read not only novels but also autobiographies and books about technical things. Try to make yourself comfortable with as many topics as you can because we never know RC related to which topic might appear in the CAT.\nVA- For VA Parajumbles, out-of-context, summary are hot topics. Prepare for those topics. When you are reading try to focus on how the sentences are connected to each other. Write the summary of the articles you read. It will definitely help you. Also build vocabulary. Even if there aren’t any direct questions in CAT, it will help you in understanding passages. They generally use few tricky words. Also prepare grammar/sentence correction and critical reasoning. In case these questions are asked you must be familiar with those topics.\n2.DILR-(32 questions)- Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning is notorious for its difficulty level. Solving 16 questions correctly gives you 99 percentile in most of the cases. But there are 5–6 doable sets in this section. All you need is proper set selection and ability to face the pressure of the exam. There is always a set on Venn Diagram(generally higher difficulty). Practice all the direct topics but we can’t expect direct sets in this section. So as soon as you are done with it try solving sets from previous CATs, Solve 3–4 sets daily. That is sufficient for his section.\n3.Quant-(34 questions)- It is the only section that has predefined syllabus. It is dependent on high-school mathematics. Start working on those concepts. Make yourself comfortable in the topics of higher importance. Nothing can be said about difficulty level of the paper so be prepared. Try to make your own shortcuts and use the methods which you find easy. Try to list all the formulas and don’t just keep them on tip of your tongue. Also learn how to apply them. Try to find out shortest methods for the problems you solve. It would save your time.\nFew general tips- Join 1–2 good test series. You’ll find 2017/2018 CAT papers online. Solve them after you are prepared well. Try to find strategies which work for you. CAT is not difficult to crack if you are prepared well.\nAll the Best!!\nCheers!!', ""Edit 1: Lot of people have requested for more information on CAT 2019 preparation plan. We have a youtube Live Session scheduled on 07th December 2018 here :\nClick here to go to youtube and set a reminder for the event, if you are reading this answer before 9.30 pm of 7th December .\nYou should start your CAT prep by starting to understand that CAT tests at max high school math, common sense and reading habit. One could also spend the next 5 minutes in understanding the history of CAT and how it has changed in the recent years.\nIndians and the penchant to “Game the system”:\nThere used to be a time when Indians gamed the system very well. Ahem, they do game it till date, in multiple places. Indians pick and choose ways to find loopholes in the system. Systems are created to be overlooked is the usual premise with which Indians work. This was applicable to CAT as well, to a large extent. However, with time, CAT has removed the gaming ability in the exam to maximum extent possible. How did they do this section wise, slowly, year after year, is detailed below.\nCurious about How CAT has transformed and adapted in the last few years?\nVerbal Ability\nFirst off, several years ago, CAT started off by reducing things that one had to remember in the verbal section. Removal of Synonyms, Antonyms, Spot the errors and the likes was done. CAT stopped testing Vocabulary. Reading comprehension was increased from 16 questions to 24 questions and the other 10 questions also became very closely related to checking one’s reading habit and ability more than anything else.\nImportance was shifted visibly to reinforce the idea of Reading, which cannot be fixed in less than a month, using shortcuts, tips, tricks and memorising words. Either you were naturally great at that (with long reading hours and great reading habits), or have cultivated the habit of reading with CAT in mind.\nData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning\nIn 2015 CAT threw a curveball in the Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning sections. Prior to that, DI section used to have really computational intensive tables, charts and graphs only. Logical reasoning was always based on logic and very few puzzles had elements of DI in it, and vice versa. This move, again, I believe is to remove the ability to game the system by practicing a gazillion standard questions and templates and getting CAT ready without actually being able to comprehend data as much as the exam wanted to test one.\nStarting from CAT 2015, DILR has become increasingly difficult/tough over the years. Otherwise one could also call it as being unpredictable, instead of tough.\nQuantitative Ability\nRecently, in 2018 edition of CAT, it has went on to fix that one section that was so far gamed by sheer practice and very less understanding. 2018 CAT quant section was not tough. It had questions that were a mix of different arithmetic topics put across in several layers, that could not be solved by plugging away memorised formulae, but actually tested understanding of the underlying ideas.\nThere were (several) questions from multiple topics that were put together into one question. Understanding of basics was primary to solving most questions. Else one got caught into a trap that had no out. Knowing hundreds of formulae just did not help with this CAT. Neither did solving super hard math problems as practice to CAT 2018.\nWhat does this has to do with my CAT 2019 Preparation?\nThis history and pattern of how the exam has changed over the years has everything to do with your CAT 2019 preparation. If you need to take away one thing from this answer, that would be this.\nDo not try to game the system. Do it the right way. It always pays.\nThis exam tests your aptitude, more importantly your temperament.\nHow do I conquer different sections?\nVerbal Ability\nVerbal ability section can be systematically improved. There are no shortcuts.\nYou do not go to a gym for 3 days, and start expecting your biceps to bulge after the first three days of doing so.\nLikewise, Preparing for VARC section is like a penance, and in some ways test of temperament in the long run. If you always incline towards shortcuts and quick results, then you are not the person the exam intends in finding.\nHow do I start reading, where do I start reading, what do I start reading.

The articles are handpicked with past CAT passages in mind & the requirement of the exam. CAT Prep Online - 2IIM.\nQuantitative Ability\nCAT Exam pattern varies year after year. Tentatively a couple of questions from number theory, more than a couple of questions from Geometry has been the trend. What has not changed in the CAT exam pattern is the importance Arithmetic topics have received over the years. Individually each topic looks like a simple obstacle. But all put together arithmetic part of the Quants could become a formidable ally.\nIf anything the importance for Arithmetic topics, especially Time Speed Distance, Ratios and Mixtures, Pipes and Cisterns, Work time and the likes has gone up significantly.\nPeople either underestimate the impact Arithmetic can have, or overlook multiple topics in arithmetic, to focus on tougher topics like Geometry or Number theory.\nWhat people don’t realise is, there was one question in CAT 2018 from PnC. One or less than one from Reminders. These are topics that are idolised & fetishised by students who want harder and harder questions and would want to feel that sense of having achieved something tangible by solving super difficult questions from these topics.\nData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning\nSpend a lot of time in solving a multitude of puzzles, including but not limited to sudoku, 2048, crosswords and the likes (it could be in any format). Doing things that keeps your brain sharp is important.\nBeing able to pick up patterns from the puzzles is the most important skill required to nail this section.\nDo not try and solve a puzzle, and then learn to solve that puzzle. Learn to look at the puzzle through the eyes of the creator. What would have been the thought process that went into creation of the puzzle? etc would be a great starting point.\nWith time, one will also get used to the idea of, maybe I will try a puzzle for 20 minutes, and will get nowhere and still not be pissed off at the paper, but will “utilise the remaining 40 minutes effectively” is something that will help in CAT. Moving on to a much difficult Quant section after such a DILR section and not getting frustrated in the third hour is “Zen like”, and are telltale signs that you are on your path to salvation and at the very least deserves an appreciation from oneself, irrespective of CAT performance & results.\nI believe I have given enough starting points for one to begin their CAT 2019 preparation.\nYou could be from anywhere in the country (and the globe of course). Not having great CAT coaching classes in your city should not be a reason for you not performing well in CAT 2019. Online courses can bring the best teacher into your study, in your palm. Who teaches matters. How is something taught also matters. Pedagogy has immense long term value in terms of saving time and effort of the CAT aspirant. Well defined course structure leading to increased accessibility is of prime importance when preparing for an intensely competitive exam, where every minute that you waste in searching for the right content matters, which you could have spent revising for a mock. Prefer not to get stuck in a place that is completely haphazard in terms of content, where you have no idea which lesson have you completed and which you haven’t and what order was that in.\nBrilliant, thoughtful and meaningful pedagogy (and the teacher) plays the most important role in selection of an Online CAT coaching for one’s requirements. Integrated Learning Management System which includes tests and analytics and helps you track your progress across devices is also important.\nThink twice when you have to buy a device. 5 years ago it was the latest fad. Now, you can have the flexibility to use the device you want to, be it a full HD, 21′ desktop monitor or a super small 4.5 inch Android phone screen. Your learner data syncs instantly without delay across devices. This flexibility is very important while choosing an online CAT coaching.\nI run 2IIM with Rajesh Balasubramanian, so do take my words with a pinch of salt.

How should working people aiming to take the CAT manage their preparations with work?,100+ Answers,['Working Professionals Preparing for CAT Exams\nCAT Preparation\nExam Strategies\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should working people aiming to take the CAT manage their preparations with work?'],"[""I graduated now from IIM B. I prepared for CAT while I was working. I used to leave from home by 9.30 - 10 times in morning and be back in home by 9 - 10 after dinner from work. Some days, I had to stay in office late. My work comes under the category of hectic ( mentally, not physically ).\nThis is what I did for the written CAT exam.\nSpend one hour every day in the morning, going through the chapters (Apti, DI, LR). I had materials, and I went chapter by chapter some day and random questions some day. Ensured I solved 20 problems in the beginning and as I progressed the speed increased tremendously.\nIn office, open a browser tab and go to Arts & Letters Daily . Ensured I read three articles each day before I leave office. I'm generally curious, so I would read some random things without any background. Helped a lot in RC.\nThe Hindu, Business standard in browser tab in office. Read in between meetings, when I was distracted etc. But, utilize time in office. Along with wordweb.\nEveryday, walk for 20 minutes or so in the night leisurely and recite to myself\nall multiplication tables ( 1 to 20 )\nSquares of numbers, cubes of numbers\nCalculate % components for 1/2, 1/3 ... 1/15\nTake 5 random numbers and compute their squares and cubes ( short cut ways )\nI know the set of people who are preparing for CAT; we especially had a guy who is very motivated and he would provide us the problems that are challenging & we would spend time discussing quickly. Mostly casual chat types. In our office, it was appreciated to prepare for exams and hence this was easy.\nWeekends, I gave one mock test, either from home or test center. I would try to solve the problem after the exams ( the ones I was not able to find quick solutions for ) & see if there are options. This would be complete in the weekend itself.\nOverall, CAT is about being in touch with the basics. You can solve the paper if you are given twice the time. It is all about speed and accuracy. These will not come unless you are in regular touch. Allot small amounts of time every day and you will surely crack it.\nAll the best for your CAT...!!!"", ""IT IS NOT AT ALL DIFFICULT. Period. Always keep this in mind.\nCAT is an exam for which you need not put in several hours of preparation daily for months. Your preparation and performance will depend A LOT on where you stand right now. If someone is comfortable with Maths, Reasoning and/or English already, the entire preparation will revolve more around developing speed and polishing the strategy with which one approaches the paper. However, CAT is not that easy either, it is not the paper that makes this exam tough but rather, the high amount of competition.\nNote that, the major constraint for us here is TIME. So, we’ll try and do these 2 things -\nReduce investing time in unnecessary activities other than what’s really important.\nThe time that we invest in CAT prep, it must have high RoI. (So, no reading newspapers, past papers, old mock tests etc)\nKeeping this in mind, these are some key points (in no specific order) which will help you in preparing for CAT alongside working -\nGet hold of study material from any institute and make sure that you go through at least QA and LR from start to end ASAP. This is extremely important.\nA very important thing (that most people don't do) is that every time you try and solve questions, do it with time limit. It will be much more effective if you get used to solving questions in time limit from day 1.\nTry and manage 3 hours at least on alternate days, this will be needed when you write mock tests on weekdays.\nTry and utilise your travel time to office for revision. Maintain a thick notebook with all the QA formulas/tricks and LR concepts/tricks and keep updating it with every mock/sectional test you give.\nMental calculations are very important. Practice this all the time, even while working.\nInstead of investing time in novels/newspapers, invest that same amount of time in solving RC passages on various themes and topics (With a time limit of course). This way, you'll practice a lot of reading as well as you'll also practice spotting answers for questions.\nTake mock test very seriously, and its analysis even more seriously. Write a mock only if you’re sure that you can focus. Do not write a mock when you’re super tired or are sure that you’ll be disturbed in between. More importantly, focus a lot on the analysis part. Identify where you went wrong. Go through the solution of the test thoroughly and write all the new formulae/tricks mentioned in the ‘thick notebook’ mentioned above.\nOnce you start mocks, maintain an excel sheet to keep track of questions in VA and QA topic wise. After every mock, during analysis, just fill this excel sheet.\nAt the end, apply a formula that will give you details about % attempt (Attempt/Total*100) and % accuracy (Correct/Ateempt*100) topic wise. After 10-15 mocks, you'll be very clear about which topic you are attempting less, where your accuracy is pathetic etc etc. It will help you much more than you realise.\nDO NOT try to do too many things. Someone will try and do mocks, various books from Indian authors, even GMAT books, then lots of reading, then improve grammar with several grammar improvement books, then vocab improvement books, solving questions on Pagalguy, solving questions on various sites, various study materials etc etc etc. KEEP IT SIMPLE. Don't get caught up with all this. Don't ask for too many suggestions. Talk to a few good people, make a good plan that you feel will work for you and just do it.\nMaximise your efforts during the weekends, significantly reduce hanging out with friends, movies etc.\nSTOP WASTING TIME.\nTrust me, it is not difficult at all. I too did it in my first CAT attempt. I had an extremely demanding on-field job as a construction engineer and was able to spare only 2-3 hours per day 6 days a week for the preparation. On Friday (Weekend in Algeria), I used to study for around 6-8 hours. As this was my first attempt, I had to start from scratch. Moreover, I didn’t have any books or materials with me to study from so I had to look for concepts and questions on the internet. All the best.\nNEVER SETTLE"", ""CAT is very difficult to handle with 9 to 6 job, but it has to be done. I started my CAT preparation after I completed 2 years at work and finally nailed it with 1.5 years of preparation. I have experienced how difficult it is to maintain work-life balance. Thus, preparing CAT along with work is next to impossible for many. Thus, it leads to two extreme steps. Either the aspirant leaves his job or he leaves his dream of an IIM tag.\nLeaving the job for CAT is too risky because of the unpredictability of the exam. If you are thinking of taking the other step, then this post is not for you. You may scroll down to read some other post.\nI am assuming the following conditions are satisfied to follow the steps mentioned in this post:\n1. Saturday & Sunday off. (Weekend off)\n2. Total time 12 hours outside the home. (Office + travel time + etc.)\n3. You have only one goal in your life and i.e. CAT.\nSome of you may get off on some other days or work unevenly on various days. So for the people whom the above assumptions are not valid. Please accommodate the schedule as per your ease.\n1. Treat each section equally: - Considering the increasing difficulty level of DI & LR with every passing year and high unpredictability of VA, do not live under the veil that you can cover one section with another. Focus on all the sections.\n2. Weekdays: - On weekdays allocate 6 (8-2 = 6) hrs. for studying (2 hrs. for each of the four sections mentioned below)\n(i) QA: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals/books. You can use any of the two mocks (IMS, Time).\n(ii) DI/LR: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals. You can use any of the three mocks (IMS, CL, Time). Practice as many sets as you can.\n(iii) VA/RC: - Do it from old mocks/sectionals. IMS mocks provides you the closest RC that you may get in CAT. You can practice from Time also but RC from Time is a bit lengthy and contains a bit easier question. The VA/RC section of last two years CAT was most similar to IMS mocks. You can use office time to practice old mocks, sectional, etc. (Given you utilize the time judiciously. Trust me, it is achievable.)\n(iv) Newspaper Reading (The Hindu Editorial): - This should be finished at the office. Do not carry this task to home. 9 to 6 job provides you enough free time to read the newspaper. If you do not get enough time during lunch or while traveling, then you can follow other alternatives. Copy the editorial/article and paste it in either XLSX or notepad and read it. This way you will be at your cubicle and can utilize your time well. Do this whenever you get free time. Don't restrict yourself to only newspaper and diversify your readings.\n3. Weekends/Holidays: - On weekends/ holidays allocate minimum 12.5 hrs. for studying.\n(i) 7.5 hrs. for studying (2.5 hrs. to each section).\n(ii) 3 hrs. for mock.\n(iii) 2 hrs. for mock analysis.\n4. Till August: - You should finish QA theory & formulas, all concepts of DI & LR and the basic understanding of different question types in VA & RC.\n5. September & October: -\n(i) You should only do revision and attempt mocks and sectionals.\n(ii) You Should give at least 2 mocks each weekend with their analysis. Do not miss any center-based mocks. Attempt them at the center to prepare yourself for the exam like scenarios. (It will make you feel comfortable on D day).\n6. Last month (November): -\n(i) 1 mock each day and along with its analysis.\n(ii) I would advise taking a month leave before CAT. If it is not possible then take at least 2 weeks off before the exam and give mocks at exactly the exam time.\n7. Meanwhile, take out time to pursue your hobbies. Keep in mind CAT is not the end, it is just the beginning of your DREAM.\nAll the Best. Please feel free to ask any query in the comment section.\nTo get answer of all other Query Please Join.\nLog into Facebook | Facebook"", 'Given the changing nature of CAT (which at a fundamental level has remained more or less the same) and the preparation required to \'crack\' an exam of this kind, planning becomes extremely important in addition to the natural skillset.\n\nConsidering you have taken CAT 2015, you are now aware of three things:\n1. Verbal preparation is not really prep prep but something that needs to be done over a long period\n2. Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation requires vast exposure to different kind of questions and logic(s)\n3. A simple formula based approach and sticking to level of difficulty 1-2-3 in Quant is good enough\n\nAlso read: Prasad Sawant\'s answer to Does CAT 2015 Stands a benchmark for future test pattern?\n\nWhen you are taking a second attempt at a test like this, your preparation strategy is quite different from your first attempt strategy.\n\nFirst attempt is like learning how to swim. You flounder, you need help, your strokes are without finesse and you somehow manage to stay afloat. And unless you do that, you don\'t reach the next level. But once you have learned what\'s required, you become better. Then you focus on cutting the water at a certain angle, perfecting your strokes, increase your lung capacity and strength, and finally, you become a good swimmer.\n\nComing back to your question, let\'s start planning your day:\nWork day: 24 hours - (9 hours of work, 2 hours of travel, 7 hours of sleep, 2 hours of food, 2 hours of buffer time spent on in-between activities & fun) = 2 hours\nNon-work day: 24 hours - (10 hours of sleep, 2 hours of food, 5 hours of buffer time spent on in-between activities & fun) = 7 hours\n\nAssuming you are dedicated enough, you will roughly have about 24 hours per week for preparation. This time can be divided as (Strong section: 7 hours, Moderate section: 8 hours, ""I-am-not-good-at-this"" section: 9 hours)\n\nPreparation means: Understanding concepts + solving questions without time limit/with time limit. One of the biggest mistakes before the second attempt is confusing familiarity and conceptual clarity. In the first six months of the calendar year, focus on preparation. In the remaining five months, focus on mocks and test taking strategy and practice.\n\nThe reason why I am not sharing a time table and talking broadly in terms of hours is because I think everyone is different and needs to have a custom plan. Only you can draft that for yourself. The next thing is to sustain the motivation and having a discipline to stick to that plan (DIFFICULT part)\n\nPost June/July, you should not feel the need to go back to the concepts book. The idea of putting more hours in the first six months is to reduce to effort required in the second half. People start getting serious 2 months before the CAT when it\'s already late. Then nothing helps.\n\nAlso, before you start your plan for CAT 2016, sit and do a thorough analysis of your last year preparation and performance. What different things are you going to do this time to ensure a significantly better result?\n\nCreate a monthly plan which is further divided in weeks and days. Keep a little buffer in case a topic is difficult to understand or long. Extreme specificity might not be required (for e.g. morning 30 minutes on 27th January for understanding sum of roots from algebra) but a broad topic wise and section wise plan is better.\n\nOnce the plan is in place, understand what material will help you achieve it. Coaching institute material + past papers + 2-3 good books should suffice. Apart from that, focus on reading anything and everything to improve your VA RC skills and Puzzles and brain teasers to improve your overall aptitude.\n\nIf you have specific things to ask, you can always message me. Hope this helps. All the best.']"

You cure it. Dont weigh stress and depression on the same scale. You need to cure it. You need to calm your body’s reaction. Your need to cultivate positive thinking pattern. You need to have a relook at what you are eating. You need to forgive and forget everyone. You need to forgive yourself. You need to be aware of the environment that you are staying, is it contributing to your issues?\nAny doctor you go(alternative), show him this message and ask him whether there is any truth in the below, if affirmative try his treatment but if not cured within 1 year find another doctor. If the doctor says this is not true, i can assure you no use taking such doctors prescriptions, you may cure the symptoms but cause will remain.\nI can understand your situation but you have to realise that this is your own making albeit unconsciously though through your repetitive mind thinking habits and that which has been embedded in your subconscious mind. It is very very difficult to erase the negative thinking pattern you have cultivated but not impossible.\nYes, you need to go to the doctor, thats for sure but whether the doctor(not modern doctor only alternative) can cure you provided he/she knows his/her medicine.\nThe issue here what majority dont realise and majority of people who has reached chronic disease stages is that they will not realise it until they experience the change, then they realise that all the while their belief is wrong.\nAlso, in these cases, it is the mind that keeps you on the lease whereas it should be you who has to keep the mind on the lease till the time the doctor doesnt calm your mind, no cure is possible. Read on..\nYes, depression can be cured provided you are ready to change your belief and that is not easy and provided you are lucky to find a doctor who knows his medicine but it is not easy. Also, important that you change your unhealthy food to eating healthy food, forgive and forget, else one can never come out of it.\nYour mind and body is out of sync due to various factors including starts with negative thinking pattern, overthinking, a habit formed unconsiously due to many situations like environmentals as below mentioned, continuous negative thoughts drain you of your precious vital chemicals in the brain due to which Neurotransmitters in your brain get to a low level due to above and/or due to below. These are body’s chemical messengers. They are the molecules used by the nervous system to transmit messages between neurons, or from neurons to muscles and your unhealtlthy eating habits habits including, eating while watching TV, eating without chewing food properly, drinking water prior to meals and immediatly after meals, eating too much, areated drinks during meals, sugar laden foods, your air freshner chemicals, microwave, your neighbourhood environment and thousands of others in your day to day life contribute why you reached depression state and only escalate the situation you are in. Eating healthy food is in your hand but controlling the environment is not in your hand so think and remove those that are under your control.\nDepression is not overrated, in modern lifestyle it has multiplied by leaps and bounds. Negative thinking pattern cultivated in early childhood or due to environment in adulthood is one of the major causes in many cases, there are many other causes that contribute and make a perfect mixture for anxiety, depression and a host of chronic disease that you will believe hard to accept, believe it or not, for those who realise this truth, there is moksh(Nirvana) and alleviation from sufferings. Read on..\nPsychiatrist do help you but it is just temporary. Modern medicines are not to cure the cause, in majority it just ensures that the symptoms associated with depression, anxiety is subsided, it does nothing to cure the cause.\nDepression is not just matter of imbalance of chemicals, it means that your mind and body synchronisation mechanism has gone for a toss, connectivity is disrupted and you need to focus on repairing it. Now, the questions would be why it happened and how to cure it.\nIt starts with fight or flight response. It could start from a young age, growing up stage(familial environment, unhealthy food eating habits, wrong food combination, the air freshner, the plastic use, mobiles, and thousands of others in this modern fast paced life(you earn money only to fund your medical treatment) including the main cause YOUR NEGATIVE THINKING PATTERN formed through habits(like in a dysfuntional family, all those affected by the arguments/fight between husband & wife, could be children, relatives and any one in that environment who day in and day out gets to hear only negative matters and this is a negstive way of releasing stress), but exception is there, from dysfuntional families or environment too there are people who remain sane/positive thinking mentality because they chose the positive thinking pattern or it could be a sudden onslought but this also starts with the brain(environment and including all listed above). Depression means that it has reached a stage where your body is not able to handle all negative thinking pattern of onslought against it(it’s like in the border, if an enemy( Country A) attacks or infiltrates, the Border Security Force(Country B) will do everything to thwart the enemy’s infilteration attempt and succeeds everytime but what if the enemy goes on relently attacking, at some point the Border Security(Country B) is bound to be invaded, this is what happens when you go on a negative thinking pattern formed through habits(you form this habit invonsciously because when you hear something in the environment, its not only your conscious mind that is listening, there is a subconscious mind also taking in all the facts and your reaction to such stress). Thus, when negatively taken, you are not only corrupting your mind but body too. At the start, if you cannot handle stress in a fight of flight situation, it doesnot matter because your chemicals in the brain nerves are sufficient to handle it, but if such onslought goes on increasing, day and night, just before you go to sleep and on waking up, you are slowly paving the way for chemical imbalances because during your stress situation, brain communicates to body through chemical messengers and if you are on 24 hours guard what can you expect if not Anxiety, Depression, Schizophrenia and many other chronic diseases including diabetes, blood pressure, etc., due to chemical imbalances.\nSurrounding yourself with happy people is very good but those self-help groups who say to ostracize depressed people are completely wrong. Always remember, depressed people need you more than anyone else, could be his belief, he thinks you are the only person who listens to him and thus he comes to you, if you dont entertain him, he might have nowhere to go and could even take a drastic step, and before taking that drastice step, he/she may message you to get some response AND here you need to respond immediately and URGENTLY. BUT that doesnt mean you have to listen to his negative discussions, you can find ways to make him understand the negativity that he carries, books below mentioned might be useful. Read below:\nRead the book by Bruce Lipton - Biology of Belief, The Alchemist? The Secret and You can heal your Life, Blinded by Science by Mathew Silverstone, Breaking the Habits of being yourself by Dr. Joe Dispenza, The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle , Many Life Many Masters by Dr Brian Weiss and any books on meditations and most important prayers when you wake up, before you go to sleep. When you wake up, give thanks and gratitude for 10 things, it could be simple thing as waking which you have taken for granted or thanking your parents, etc.\nYour subconscious mind is like a hard disk of your computer yet 1000 times more powerful than computer, it saves all your emotions, habits, faith, memories and feelings and at appropriate time throws it out. Garbage in and Garbage out.\nClink on Best 50D sound fress mind use headphones for best sound effects (Best 50D sound fress mind use headphones for best sound effects (Best 50D sound fress mind use headphones for best sound effects)) use headphones and see the sound effects on both ears.\nEverthing starts with the word STRESS. Various forms of stress are there. The response to such stressful event occurs to maintain a balance. The body's stress response can be both helpful and harmful but in today's modern fast paced life, it is when such threat or perceived stress persists and in most families it persists, then it leads to chemical imbalances and to variety of diseases like Anxiety, Depression, Physchosis, Schizophrenia and even cancer. In those with above, the truth is that stress response does not stop.\nAnxiety and Depression is end result and fruit of negatively thinking pattern. Like you thinketh, you become. It means that the body has been tuned to this state by days, weeks, months and in severe cases years of negative thinking pattern. A 360 degree change of thinking pattern is the need of the hour but it is not easier than said. Human Being are not born depressed. These are not obtained from genes. It is the belief that one has acculmulated based on their toxic beliefs and thinking patterns about themselves and other people. When this false belief is untrained, you are on your way to getting CURED.\nFor majority of patient’s, without doctor’s intervention it is not possible to cure anxiety and depression. Modern medicine cures the symptoms but does not cure the CAUSE. Most of the time you become a slave to the medicine and you cannot function normally without it. Also, you will find that continuous use of antidepressants mitigates the efficiancy and stiil depression exist. Off course there are other side effects and give rise to other health conditions if used continuously. In case you are on antidepressant never stop. If you are going for alternative, reduce the dosage slowely if you feel alternative is effective. Never stop at once. For alternatives, read below.\nThe best option is Homeopathy or other alternatives like Ayurveda which cure the cause but but you really need to be lucky and make serious efforts to locate a doctor who knows his medicine because if the doctor doesnt know his medicine it can escalate the depression. Doctors you will find a many but a doctor who knows his medicine very few.""]"
What is more important in the CAT mocks: percentile or actual score? What should be taken as a parameter for judging the performance?,5 Answers,['CAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExams and Tests\nWhat is more important in the CAT mocks: percentile or actual score? What should be taken as a parameter for judging the performance?'],"['It depends.\nPercentile and actual score both are important in case of CAT mocks.\nIf number of mock takers are more and the difficulty level of mock is upto actual CAT paper than both percentile and actual score is important. If number of test takers are less than actual score is only important.\nA lots of mock test series available in market and all aspirants not enrolled with same test series so we can not give more importance to percentile. So finally i can say “Actual score is more important in CAT mocks”.\nAnalysis yourself by mock test is the most important thing. You can identify your weak and strong area by these mocks. There are many Mock test series available now the days who give the complete analysis of your mock like weak area, strong area. Click on the give link- Mock Test Series for CAT, XAT, NMAT, SNAP, IBPS PO and SBI PO . This mock will provide a complete analysis after every mock.\nAnalysis every mock on your side also and Keep following points in your mind during this-\nFocus on the number of errors made. Try to minimize errors, they don’t have more than 2 in QA section, not more than 2 in LRDI section, not more than 20% in VARC section. If you are doing more error than this number means you are also attempting those question also whom your are not 100% sure.\nLook beyond scores and percentiles. Score and percentile is just a number, they might make you feel good or bad but you have to look beyond this.\nAttempt the entire paper again. An average CAT aspirant attempts 50–60 question in mock mean they have miss out a large number of good questions. Re-attempt it again without time pressure.\nAnalyze your question, set, passage selection. After re-attempt the mock evaluate yourself on those parameters- Did I attempt the correct questions in Quant?, Did I pick the right sets in LR/DI?, Did I pick the right passages in RC? etc in my first attempt.\nIdentify the strategy that works best for you. Follow a strategy that will help you to solve more question. According to me attempt every section in two phases. In phase 1 attempt all easy question that you can solve easily in less time and mark those question that can be solved by you but they take more time. In phase 2 attempt all marked question. This strategy will sure you that you don’t leave any easy question.\nFigure out the number of mocks you need. Attempt at-least 10 mocks before CAT exam.\nDo not attempt section wise mock. Always attempt full length mocks. Because full length mocks will feel you actual exam not section wise mock.\nIdentify your weak areas. After analysis 2–3 mocks, you will identify your weak areas and than work out on that before attempting next mock.\nCheck if you are slipping in your strong areas. Some time this happen when you are over confident on your strong area and don’t give enough time to this. You can identify this during identify weak area. This should not be happen, if this is happen than work out on it also.\nPlan your next mock. After a mock analysis you can allot time for your weak area, other thing etc than schedule next mock.\nIf you are looking Online Course for CAT preparation than go through this link- Online CAT Coaching Course for CAT 2018 Exam Preparation\nGood luck for your bright future.\nJai Hind!', 'A2A\nStandalone, neither is of absolute importance in my opinion.\nAs is the case with CAT, the mocks also tell you where you stand with regard to the test taking population. However, the sample set is so concentrated that it is impossible to draw valid conclusions from your mock percentiles alone. The number of serious takers forms a big percentage of the total number of people taking mocks (roughly 50% or even more if fewer people are taking a test). In case of the CAT however, there will be around 75–80 percent of the population that doesn’t prepare seriously in any capacity. So, while you might start from a 50 percentile level in your mock, you effectively start at a 75 percentile level at the CAT.\nWith regard to absolute scores, it completely depends on the level of difficulty of each section and while most of the mocks tend to be close to the previous CAT, or slightly tougher, there would generally be a few mocks that try to sensitize you to uncommon scenarios (which, is of course a good practice because you never know what the CAT would look like that year). So, again we cannot really say that if you get X marks in a mock, it would translate into a Y at the CAT.\nThe takeaway in my opinion is more of decision making than anything else. Throughout the mock taking phase, your focus should be on identifying easy and difficult questions as quickly as possible thereby optimizing the time you would have. The content part plays a support role in making sure that you solve the easy and moderate questions using the shortest possible method. The best candidates out there are the ones who can decide extremely quickly if a question deserves their attention or not (in fact that was exactly the theme of CAT 2018 in case you haven’t seen the analysis yet).\nSo, to sum it up, try to build at least basic content before the mock season starts (you might want to attempt a handful of past CAT papers to understand what all topics are frequently tested) and test your decision making in the actual mocks. As you progress, you can improve your preparation from a section level (for example: VA/QA/LR is my strongest/weakest section) to a topic level (for example: PnC/Geometry/Numbers is my strongest/weakest topic) to a question level (for example: replacement in a mixtures question is something I am not comfortable with).\nHope that helps.', 'Hi Samridhi\nI believe two things that matter the most in tracking one’s performance are:\nPercentile\nAccuracy\nScore can fluctuate based on the level of the paper but the percentile should remain consistently at the required mark as per your preparation and expectations or go higher as per plans. Similarly, number of attempts can go up or down depending on the level of the paper, but what matters most is your accuracy. Not saying these parameters are the only ones that matter: speed, selection, number of attempts etc. are also important; but my top two picks to monitor one’s performance are percentile and accuracy.\nBest wishes\nIf you want to attend a CAT 19–20 strategy meet in Delhi, you can join this event: Invitations, Free eCards and Party Planning Ideas from Evite', 'The score matters more than the percentile. The percentile is based on what others do. And, the students who take mocks of a certain institute can not accurately reflect the those who are going to take the actual CAT.\nAnd, when you look at the score , you realize that there is always a scope for improvement. It always keeps on your toes. It makes you strive harder and harder.\nSo the score matters more…\nBut ultimately the analysis of your performance matters more than the score. Knowing the mistakes that you have done in mocks will help you do better in the actual CAT.']"
How did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?,100+ Answers,['Prepathon\nExam and Test Results\nCommon Admission Test Percentiles\nPercentile\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExams and Tests\nHow did 99+ percentilers prepare for CAT?'],"['My authority on the subject? I scored a 99.75 percentile in CAT, 99.55 in XAT, 99.45 in SNAP. This is a walkthrough of my preparation/ how you can go about preparing for CAT and other entrance exams.\nCAT is considered to be one of the most difficult entrance exams in India, but it is isn’t as difficult as it’s made out to be. Most of the topics that are tested in CAT are High school level topics. The difficulty lies in the fear of the test. Most CAT aspirants resign to an assumption that they can’t score above a certain percentile without even knowing what the test is made off, half the game is lost at this point.\nI have been guilty of the same myself. Jan 2016, I remember looking at lists of MBA colleges and immediately rejecting the top 30 odd colleges for the fact that they all required you to score above 97 percentile or so to realistically make into those colleges. It was only when I talked to my father and he explained to me the negativity in my thinking, that I realised, I hadn’t even seen what CAT consisted of. I had no logic in leaving out the possibility of scoring an extremely high percentile.\nAnother reason why I felt that I had to score an extremely high percentile were my 12th class marks. MBA colleges give weightage to academic profile. A self-analysis made me realise that having a low score in my 12th class (69%) was a huge handicap. If I had got a low percentile I would’ve found it extremely difficult to make into the colleges of the relevant level. I would’ve ended up in colleges ranked even lower. I had to score a 99+ percentile. BELIEVE you can Crack the CAT\nHow to go about:\nI have divided the preparation for CAT into four parts:\nPre-preparation, Preparation, Practice, Taking the CAT\nPre-Preparation\nThere are a few things you’ll want to have in place before you start your preparation for CAT and other exams.\nFind three hours a day (not in bits and pieces here and there) three continuous hours to prepare. This can be extremely difficult if you are working/ attending college. This might help you to find a few extra hours a day.\nGet rid of any distractions that you believe affect your concentration or mental state in general. (social media is one of the biggest time-suck and tends to distract you even if you aren’t online)\nGet in touch with someone who has cracked the entrance exam or has some expertise in the same, you could approach a local coaching centre. (you may not enrol as a full-time student but you would want to be in touch with the faculty there by buying their material or tests etc.) This will be helpful in getting certain finner tips and in case you have difficulties.\nGet yourself a campaign manager. Cracking the CAT and getting an admission into an MBA college is a long drawn process. You are bound to lose interest or forget important things/ deadlines. Get someone who will keep track of the same. For me, it was my father who helped me keep track of my preparation and all the college applications. Make sure the person you chose exactly understands the process and understands what you want. They will make sure that you are still going even when the motivation starts to run out.\nRead a lot. This is extremely important when it comes to the verbal ability section of CAT. You will need a lot of broad-based readings and an ability to make sense of what you have read quickly. The passages for reading comprehension in CAT are sometimes extremely abstract and can be extremely difficult to make sense if you aren’t used to reading a lot. Places where you should want to read from: Medium, The guardian, Businessweek Bloomberg, Also read some classic novels that you can lay your hands on, the books talked about on crash course literature are a good place to start.\nPreparation\nCAT is divided into 3 sections verbal ability reading comprehension, logical reasoning data interpretation, and quantitative ability. Each of the sections requires equal effort and attention.\nTime for preparation: There are many people and sites who will tell you that you need 14 hours a day to prepare for CAT. Trust me that doesn’t work. You just need 3 to 4 hours a day consistently over a period of 3- 4 months to crack CAT. Anything more than 5 hours a day can and will burn you out.\nSource material for preparation: A common mistake that most aspirants will make is relying on just one book/ one source for preparation (particularly anyone who takes coaching). It is recommended that you have access to at least some material from different authors. This will provide you with multiple points of view for the same problems. (same goes for mock tests recommended that take at least 4 to 5 tests from A differen source).\nVerbal Ability & Reading Comprehension\nThis is one of the most frustrating sections in CAT. The question often can seem to have multiple solutions and where options are provided all of them seem correct. Even if you are extremely good with English you can end up messing this section.\nThe key to cracking this section (particularly Verbal ability part) is understanding that this section is more about logic than language. You have to understand the logic as to how the solutions are arrived at (jumbled para is the killer in this section).\nI initially worked this section by looking at the solutions, that way I was able to see what patterns to look out for and what logic to apply.\nWork on improving your ability to comprehend complex /long sentences, particularly from topics that you aren’t used to and having complex vocabulary.\nThis section will take a lot of practice to master, more practice than the other two sections. This section has the highest returns for scores. If you get a slightly higher score in this section your percentile can increase drastically. (I scored a 99.98 percentile in this section).\nEven if you have a good command over the language DO NOT take this section lightly, I know of aspirants who have the CAT along with me having excellent command over the language yet messing up this section completely.\nData interpretation and logical reasoning\nData interpretation is a practice intensive section. There is nothing new that you have to learn in this section. It is just the ability to carry out basic calculations using tools you already have (percentages, averages, summation, division). Practice these basic tools thoroughly so that you are extremely comfortable with them. Also get acquainted with all the various forms of data presentation, such as graphs, pie charts, tables, caselets etc.\nLogical reasoning is a section which you should and can make the most out of it. The questions are very often similar. While practising logical reasoning the things you would want to learn is gauging the difficulty of the question quickly. If a question is difficult, move on to the next one (time is important).\nYou would want to practice visualising the problem (in mind / on paper ) in the simplest way possible. This will help you breakdown huge paragraphs full of seemingly meaningless words into sensible data.\nLearn to have an unbiased mind. One of the mistakes you can make in this section is assume somehting that isnt true. Learn to use all the information provided and only than make any conclusion.\nRead the data carefully a single word can change the whole situation. (for ex. XYZ is not wearing a black pant. can easily be mistaken for XYZ wearing a pant if you miss out on the not.)\nQuantitative ability\nThis is one of the more easier sections to get by, You just have to understand the concepts behind all the topics involved. Again the topics in this section are high school level math. You can over prepare for this section and most aspirants do.\nThere are certain topics in this section that you would want to be extremely thorough with since they appear most frequently (going by the trends of past so many years), such as time speed distance, time work, Geometry, Functions.\nYou would want to also be thorough with averages alligations, percentages ratios since these topics are more helpful in DI section but very rarely make an appearance as stand-alone questions in QA section.\nNumber systems personally I felt for me was an extremely overrated topic ( I spent way more time than required here)\nPractice\nTaking mock tests, I feel mock tests will be the most important part of your preparation as they help you guage exactly where you stand. (another benefit is to know which colleges you should apply to).\nWhat is a good number of mock tests to take? There isn’t any concensus on this topic, there are CAT toppers who got by on hardly any mock tests, and than there are people like me who took close 40 mock tests.\nPersonally mock tests where the biggest source of practice for me. I took mock tests from 3 different sources. ( I recommend atleast 2 different sources). Once you have taken a mock test it’s extremely important that you analyse them well, I spent about an hour and half after every mock test to analyse where I have gone wrong and what can be changed. Mock tests are also a good time to test out strategies in handling various sections. (I will try to come with a detailed post about analysing mock tests.)\nI will boast a little here, but thanks to the trends on my mock tests I was extremely confident of getting the percentile I got on CAT. ( I expected at least a 99.5 %le)\nI recommend practicing during the time slot you will actually be answering the CAT, I had to take the CAT on a sunday in the morning slot (9.30 to 12.30) at a centre 30 kms away from home. Considering the reporting time of an extra hour, I would have to technically leave my house at 7 in the morning on the day of the test. I usually get hungry within 2 and half hours of eating anything. So in the month before CAT I trained my body, by having breakfast at 6 in the morning and not having anything till 1pm. I also trained myself to sit at one place for 4 hours (830 to 1230). This may seem funny/ unnecessary but on the day of the test you dont want to have any other factors troubling you.\nTaking the CAT\nTry to stop preparation for CAT at least 3 days before CAT (there are people who will disagree and reccommend you remain in the mood and keep preparing) anything you try to “prepare” during these last days often will be of very little help. Don’t wander away from the CAT mood though, read or at least make sure you are sitting 3 hours at a place for these last few days ( to stay in the CAT mood).\nDo not take a mock test in the few days before CAT, If you mess the mock it is likely that you will panic on the day of the CAT.\nDo not keep any expectations as to the number of questions you want to complete in each section.\nAll the best for your preparation for CAT.\nP.S. CAT isn’t everything, CAT is hardly a learning experience, you won’t learn anything new as such (well other than how to prepare hard) it’s mostly about things you already know, taking the CAT can hence be a very frustrating experience. I recommend that you learn something else too on the side lines, get a hobby or hold a job (again debatable as to how much time you can find etc.) If you are taking drop read a lot, read all the books you can get your hands on. All in all try to do something else too that will help you grow.\nBelling the CAT and other entrance exams', 'This answer is fairly long, about 7000 words. So I have divided my answer into 9 parts wherein each part can be read independently. However reading the entire answer in one go will serve as RC practice, so that would be advisable.\nWhat I have mentioned below helped me in my journey from 66% -> 99.85% in CAT. I have tried my level best to be as detailed as possible. GK as a section is not there in CAT as of now but is very important in the other papers like XAT, IIFT, SNAP, etc. So, I have included that as well. I have also put in a little bit about how to attempt mocks and then analyse them to improve further. A little bit on GD-PI-WAT as well, so that this answer serves all your needs.\nI would like to point out that I have been an average student all my life and am a GEM (General Engineer Male), yes pun intended. My 10/12/B.Tech scores are 83/79/66. With that I made it to IIM Calcutta, so the first thing that you should now do is stop worrying about your previous grades. 99% of the people reading this will surely have better grades. So, if I can you obviously can get through and study at an IIM.\nMy CAT 2015 score card:\nQA: 99.8%\nLRDI: 99.96%\nVA: 87.33%\nOA: 99.85%\nThis answer is divided into the following parts:\nA.) How to start?\nB.) QA -> Quantitative Ability\nC.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning\nD.) VA -> Verbal Ability\nE.) GK -> General Knowledge\nF.) How to attempt mocks? (Non-CAT exams at the end)\nG.) How to analyse mocks?\nH.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?\nI.) GD-PI-WAT prep\nA.) How to start CAT prep?\nRegister at any site which lets you attempt and review a mock for free. You could try hitbullseye. If you have already enrolled for a test series or for a classroom programme, then attempt one of their mocks. Many of you would be like bhai abhi toh padhai start bhi nahi ki, mock deke kya hoga aur upar se aadhe questions toh samajh bhi nahi aayenge aur maths ke formula bhi yaad nahi hain. Additionally while attempting the mock, there will be multiple instances when you will feel like getting up because you are not used to solving questions for 3 hours at a stretch. Your brain will also try to deceive you into grabbing your smart phone for checking Whatsapp. You will feel like drinking water, you will also be tempted to check FB. The point of this test is to make sure that all this doesn’t happen when you actually attempt CAT. Now you would be thinking what is the point in attempting a mock when I don’t know $hi+.Precisely my point! The main reason for this mock was to identify what you know, what you don’t, where you stand and how much hard work is required.\nOnce you are done with the mock, check the solutions and find the topics which you already know, which you attempted correctly. Some problems would have been there which you would have been sure of but you got them wrong because you were out of touch and forgot the formula or recalled an incorrect formula. You probably forgot the plural of fish. Fish or fishes? Or does it depend on whether I am talking about a species of fish or multiple units of the same species? Then you will realise that a little brush up of a few topics (which you are out of touch with) will dramatically improve your score. Work on these topics first and then move on to topics which you have no clue about. This mock decides your future course of study.\nNow, on to the preparation phase.\nB.) QA -> Quantitative Ability\nStart off with this site. http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/Click on start and then check your score. You know where you stand. Keep practising a few times every day and your score will keep improving. If you can hit 50-55 consistently in the default 120 seconds, you will easily hit 99.5% in CAT in this section.\nIf you are targeting 99.5+ then I would also like you to memorise the following:\nB1.) Reciprocals, Squares and Cubes up till 30.\nPay attention here, some values will get repeated.\nAs for 1/7. Remember that it is .142857. For other go up to 2-3 decimals,whatever you are comfortable with. I would prefer 3 decimals though.\nB2.) Power of 2 up till 12\nPower of 3 up till 8\nPower of 4 up till 6\nPower of 5-6 up till 5\nPower of 7-10 up till 4\nPower of 11-13 up till 3\nAgain same as above. Some values will be the same. 4^6 has already been covered till 2^12 and so on. Don’t just mug up blindly, pay attention to the numbers.\nB3.) Square Root up till 10\nB4.) Factorial up till 10\nB1-B4: Now most of you would be like, dude they give an inbuilt calculator. But then other exams don’t have that calculator. Additionally who do you think will take lesser time in solving a question? A person who uses the calculator for finding 12^3 or someone who just knows it is 1728. Believe me when I say that this is very important for your LRDI section as well. This will decide whether you get stuck at 99.5% or go beyond that. This is the deciding factor. Please memorise these values.\nB5.) A few important numbers like 999=27*37, 1001=7*11*13, 21^3=9261.\nB6.) Some numbers have the property wherein the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the no itself. 1, 2, 145 and 40585. Please remember these.\nB7.) There are 15 primes till 50, 25 till 100, 46 till 200 and 168 till 1000.\nB8.) How to find the sum of the first n natural nos. Sum of squares of n natural nos. Sum of cubes, sum of 4th powers. Please remember the formulas. Specially the last one (fourth power), most people forget that.\nB9.) Scale is not allowed in any of the exams. What the CAT authorities mean is that the scale which we used back in school that is not allowed. They never said anything about using your hand as a scale. Check the length of your fingers. Also check the length of the 3 sub division on your fingers. Use your right or left hand, whatever suits you. Please make sure that you remember these values by heart. These values will help you solve 90% of the geometry questions. Also, buy a protractor and make sure you can make the angles 30, 45, 60, 90 properly. First with the protractor and then without it. Based on the question, make a rough figure. Then based on your lengths, find the answer and then scale up to the value given in the question. Geometry has a lot of formulas, memorize them or use this approach. Approximation ftw!\nB.10.) Unitary Method. Make sure you are good with this, half the QA syllabus can be solved using unitary method. Do you think whatever has been mentioned in B9 is basically Unitary Method at the end for getting the answer?\nMost of the students go for solving the maximum no of problems. Don’t do that. Focus on the basics, don\'t go for solving questions directly like most students. Most students don’t score 99+. You are different, work differently. This is how you should be doing it for any given chapter day wise. First day go after the formulas and try to understand why a certain formula is there. Make sure that you have memorised all the formulas for that chapter. If you were to set the paper, what could be a possible question? Read a formula, try to frame questions on that formula and then memorize the formula. Just memorizing all formulas in one go won\'t help, because you will probably forget. If you can do this, then you would have solved all the questions by the time you finish reading the theory.\nExample: Let\'s say you are studying Numbers. You see the formulas for HCF and LCM of 2 nos. Then you see the factors of a number. Now think of possible questions on this. Let\'s say 72.\n1.) How many odd factors are there?\n2.) How many even factors are there?\n3.) What is the sum of the odd factors?\n4.) What is the sum of the even factors?\n5.) What is the product of the odd factors?\n6.) What is the product of the even factors?\n7.) How many factors are squares of natural numbers?\n8.) How many factors are cubes of natural numbers?\nGood going, you just completed half the chapter! Similarly think of more questions that you can make. The exercise at the end is filled with such questions. It depends on your thinking. Focus on this. If basics are fine,questions won\'t be a problem.\nWould you memorize 456*876 and 235*9865 and things like that or learn how multiplication works?\nIf you think that you lack imagination when it comes to maths and can’t do the above, then no problem. As mentioned above, by the end of the first day you would be done with memorising all the formulas. That’s it. Don’t solve anything. Just make sure all the formulas are deeply rooted in your brain and you can recall them anytime you want. Now take a break for a day. On the 3rd day, start solving problems. But remember that you are to solve by recalling the formula not by turning over the pages and looking at the formula. If you cannot recall, then please make sure you memorize the formulas again. Solve a few problems. Take a day’s break and continue solving on the 5th and similarly on the 7th day as well. This way apart from the formula getting imprinted in your brain multiple times, you will also understand which formulas are asked more often than others. Some chapters are connected to one another. Make groups of such chapters. If working on a group, try to complete all the topics in that group. For example:\nRatio Proportion, Unitary Method, Percentage, Profit and Loss.\nSimple equations, Simultaneous equations, Inequalities, Time speed distance and work, Quadratic.\nProgression.\nNumbers, Bases, Miscellaneous equations.\nSurds and Indices, Logarithms.\nMensuration.\nGeometry.\nCoordinate Geometry.\nProbability and PnC.\nFunctions and Graphs.\nFor people trying to clear the cut off in this section. The first 3 with mensuration and a bit of geometry/numbers will be enough.\nC.) LRDI -> Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning\nData Interpretation is speed and practise. The site mentioned in the Quant region and B1-B4 there would be of immense help. These will increase your speed. Generally each and every DI set has at least a problem on percentage or ratio.\nToday when you start, start off with the sole intention of solving all the questions of a given set. When you can do that on a daily basis. Move to 2 sets a day. When you can do that. Move to 3 sets daily and then to 4 sets. Keep solving as many questions as you can. Time taken per question will decrease with practise. A few months after you were born, you started to crawl, then you started walking and finally you started running. Same thing here. Don’t think about speed now. Speed comes gradually. Let nature take its course.\nLogical Reasoning, as the name suggests is based on how well you can interpret and analyse things. LR checks your thought process, it checks how you tackle problems. Get this book ""Puzzles"" by George J. Summers. When you watch a football match, why do you watch it? Probably because you want your team to win or you want to see a good contest and enjoy. Similarly, once you have bought this book, think about your objective. It’s not about getting the correct solution, it’s about improving your thought process. And additionally the puzzles in this book are tough. You could think of it as the daddy of Irodov. Engineers will get the joke! You won’t be able to solve most of the problems and frankly speaking I don’t expect you to. However, what I do expect from you is to read a question. Try to understand what has been given. Try to understand what is being asked. Think about it for say 10-15 minutes. Write down whatever approach you can think of. If you could not solve it, look at the hints and their solution scheme. Were you thinking in the right direction?Analyse the difference between the method given in the book and your method.Try to understand what you missed because of which you could not solve the puzzle. Try again for 30 minutes. If you can solve it, good enough, if not maybe try again. After a few more tries look at the solution. Remember you bought the book to improve your thought process, not to solve each question in the first attempt. Trying a puzzle for 5 minutes and then looking at the solution will take you nowhere. Solving again and again till the time you get the answer is what the book was bought for. To make sure that you can think and get the answer on your own. The answer at the end is just for verification. 1-2 puzzles a day. 3 at max, not more than that. You have to improve your thought process,not complete the book as fast as possible. Your scores in the LR section will improve in a month’s time and then it will stay at 99%.\nAnother very important point would be to memorize the alphabet-number conversion table. A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. You will come across questions on this in your mocks as well as in the exams.\nD.) VA -> Verbal Ability\nI had 69 and 72 in English in 10 and 12 respectively. My verbal score in CAT went up from 43 -> 87%. Whatever I have written below is what I did to make sure that I cleared the verbal cut off comfortably. If you are looking at a 99+verbal score, then you would be better off by reading the other answers to this question for improving your verbal section. This part is not for you kindly move on to the LRDI section. If you however $uck at English just like me, then this just might help you in clearing the sectional cut off. I tried memorizing words from the GRE word list. My language skills were not good enough to use words like persiflage, perspicuous, ubiquitous, scintillating, etc. in sentences. So, I would keep memorizing and then keep forgetting these words. I had never read novels so I had never come across such words as well. So, I came to the conclusion that memorising words won’t help me. But, a decent vocabulary is needed for CAT. So, I bought this book “Word Power Made Easy” by Normal Lewis. Managed to complete the chapters in a few months. I didn’t do the word list at the end. I would request you to buy this book and complete the chapters.\nAnother thing that seemed obvious to me was that whether you look at RCs or Para Jumbles or Para Completion or Para Summary. All these have basically been written by some person who had a very good command over the English language. So all these things should logically have a flow of thought with which the author would have written the entire thing. You just have to understand that flow. If you can understand an RC, then understanding a paragraph from that RC will obviously be very easy for you. Think about it, a PJ or a PC or a PS are basically paragraphs taken from an RC. You just have to understand the flow in which the entire thing was written by some person who had a decent understanding of the English language. But, then I again had a problem. The Verbal section in CAT was supposed to be of 1 hour and as soon as I would start reading an RC, 8-10 minutes down the line I would feel drowsy. I would start thinking about checking FB or Whatsapp or practically doing anything apart from reading that stupid RC. All those Speed reading techniques, skimming, reading the question first and all. None of that mattered. I understood what my problem was. COMPREHENSION and CONCENTRATION. By the time I was in the 2nd para I would have forgotten what was written in the 1st para. It’s called a READING COMPREHENSION for a reason. Never trade comprehension for speed.\nHow to improve comprehension and concentration?\n\nBoth will improve gradually with time. First step is to make sure that you don’t feel drowsy when reading for an hour. You will be required to do that in the exam. So you need to build your stamina to concentrate. Start off by reading 2-3k word long articles on News, sport and opinion from the Guardian\'s global edition | The Guardian. Register on the website and you will get a mail every morning at 10am. Read all the articles from there. Make sure you read at a stretch for an hour. Read everything from Culture to Technology to Art to Literature. In the beginning you will feel sleepy within a few minutes of starting. Slowly you will gain rhythm. Within 15 days you will be able to read 1 hour at a stretch. In a month’s time you will start retaining information as well. Then focus on just 1 category every day. Like only Philosophy or only Art or only culture. With that your stamina and concentration will increase further and since you are reading about only 1 thing for 1 hour, your knowledge in that topic will also increase. This can be done at home, but preferably in office to better utilize your time. PJ PC PS are all extensions of an RC. All will seem easy once you are comfortable with RCs. Here News, sport and opinion from the Guardian\'s global edition | The Guardian you will be reading 2000-3000 word long articles. Once you are used to this, 500-600 word passages in CAT and other exams will be a piece of cake for you!\nFor verbal, always eliminate choices and then mark rather than directly trying to find the correct answer. This section is different from the other sections,so it has to be dealt in a different manner. Please eliminate choices and then answer. If in doubt, leave. As for the grammar section, I have no idea when to use have and when to use has. Same with is/are and things like that. Neither can I spot grammatical errors in sentences. So, I mostly leave such questions.But I always read them. You can always answer a few of them based on instinct. Some sitters are always there in every paper.\nE.) GK -> General Knowledge\nAll the papers except CAT have this section. Some have a sectional cut off,some don’t. This section can be answered in about 5 minutes. It has the highest marks/min for any section. This section is the key to a high percentile. This section will give you the points for speaking in a GD and PI and also for writing in WAT. So, if you plan on getting through to a good B-School don’t ignore it. There would be 2 methods to prepare for this.\nE1.) Start reading any newspaper. Go through the headlines and all. Make sure you are updated with what is happening in the country. After a week or so, you will realise that it’s mostly the same thing that keeps getting repeated everyday in the paper. Think of it from the point of view of the exam. There will be MCQs. So they won’t ask for your opinion on Kejriwal vs Modi. Leave all the pages on politics. That’s sheer wastage of time. Don’t waste time on that stuff! Make sure you remember the schemes which Mr Modi keeps rolling out. At least remember the important ones. Did any big firm buy another one? Any Indian who won some award abroad. Who won which Grand Slam? Who won the Pulitzer Prize? Who won the Arjuna Khel Ratna Award? India is working on the Chabahar port with which country? Malcom Turnbull is from which country? I think you would have understood what is expected from you. MBA is about business. Focus on economic and business news more than others. Noble Prize in economics fort his year? How many Deputy Governors are there in the Reserve Bank? Make a doc file with these details. You file would look somewhat like this.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document...\nThis is what I had made for this year, so no this won’t help you! You will have to make one with the current affairs of this year. Since you will be working the entire year making this, so by the time the exams are a week away, you will have such a file. You might however think that this is too much work. In that case I would suggest you try the second and relatively easier method compared to this.\nE2.) Whichever is the first exam for you which will have a GK section, keep 4 days before that exam for making this file and memorizing it. Gather all the monthly booklets which are given to Time students. Each book has about 100 questions. Memorize the ones you think are important. CL and Time both will also have a few sheets on GK, current affairs, etc. Get those as well. CL GK compendium. Hitbullseye gk pdfs are also there. You can get most of these online for free or search on Pagalguy, someone would have uploaded it there for sure. Whatever you think is important, please memorize that. 4 days is more than enough to complete all the material I have mentioned above. By going through the monthly magazines you will also be able to keep track of what is happening in India and also round the globe.\nThe regular reading (The first method, reading daily) means that when the exam sare about to start, you would have completed most of the things. The last 4 days will serve as a revision for you. I did both the above things. So if you have time go for it. A close friend of mine, Prateek, he was preparing for UPSC. He was of immense help! Whenever I would meet him, we would talk about how things going on in our country. Served as revision for him and I would stay updated with facts. So, if you can find someone who is preparing for UPSC religiously,i t would be great. You will also have a contact who is an IAS officer. If you want to score even higher in GK get a small yearbook from some shop. Small ones general contain 100 odd pages, going through that will serve as revision as well.\nF.) How to attempt mocks (Non-CAT exams at the end)\n\nThe first step here is to make sure that you can sit and concentrate properly for 3 hours at a stretch. FB, Whatsapp, drowsiness, drinking water or the sudden urge to go to the washroom during these 3 hours have to be removed.Kindly take care of such things which might disturb you, especially the last 2 and then start a mock. When you are attempting the mock, the only thing in your mind should be about maximising your score! Another point that you should keep in mind in that no one cares about what you know and what you don’t. The only thing that matters is your score. So please keep your ego aside when attempting the paper. Yeh question kaise nahi bana, kal hi toh banaya tha and then you spend the next 15 mins on it and still end up marking the wrong answer. Please don’t! You have a fight with your girlfriend and then you are like “I am not texting her first”. Yes I was talking about that very ego of yours, please get rid of it when you are attempting a mock. If you can’t solve a question then please move on to the next one. The examination hall is not the place to derive a formula and then solve the concerned problem. Anyways, I could go on but I think I have made my point.\nRemember that half the paper is very easy, mostly formula based. Your approach should be to attempt these questions first. Make sure that you have touched the 97-98% mark and then move on to the difficult questions for improving your score.\nF1.) QA -> Quantitative Ability\n\nYou are not supposed to start from question no 1 and then continue till 34. Most of the times you will not even be able to look at some of the problems in the end. So we will follow a Round by round approach. About 50% of the problems are direct formula based. When you start this section (Round 1), keep the above point in mind. So, as soon as you look at a question. Can you solve it in a minute by using a formula? If the question with a formula was given to a 5th grader, would he be able to solve it. If yes, then solve this question. Use the values given in the question, get the answer and then move on to the next question. If you see a question and you are like, yaar yeh toh banaya hua hai, 2-3 min lagega, lamba question hai. Or if you are like sirf cases likhne hain, phir count kar lunga, phir answer. Such questions which you know you can solve but are not direct formula based, are to be left out now. These have to be attempted in the 2nd round. Getting my point? If formula based, then attempt else next. Within 30 minutes you should have attempted about 16-17 questions and you would have seen all the questions. That will get you at least 97-98% in this section.\nNow Round 2, there were a few questions which you had seen earlier and were pretty confident about. This is where your brain will help you. The human mind is so awesome that even though you just looked at it once but solved different questions and totally forgot about it, you brain was working on that question subconsciously without you having any idea about it. Now, when you read the question, you will take a lesser amount of time to solve it compared to what you would have taken had you solved it in the first round itself. You could go for Round 3 as well, your choice! But 2 rounds are needed. Please stop with a single round method which most of you are used to now.\nWhy this approach?\nMany people are most often not able to see the entire paper,so they miss sitters. This round by round technique helps you go through the entire paper and thereby select the easiest ones which in turn maximises your score. You won’t get a prize if you solve a question that only 10 students out of 2 lac could solve. The marks per question is the same. Since you solve the easier problems first, the chances of your committing mistakes goes down considerably. A question which you have solved but incorrectly is not wasted time and only a -1 for your score. Instead of 3 you get a -1. So such a question effectively hits you with lost time and a -4. This method reduces the no of such questions. Hence, this approach.\nF2.) DILR -> Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning\n\nIf you have tried solving the book which I had mentioned above, you would by now have a fair idea about how to make a table for solving LR problems. 5 people, 5 countries, 5 cars, 5 pets. All of us have solved such puzzles,haven’t we? You would obviously have 4 columns but which would be the first and which would be the second, etc. That determines how fast you will be able to solve the set. Oh, you thought it didn’t make a difference? It does! Sometimes you are better off soling set theory problems by a table. This is where your practise and experience comes into play. Making the proper table means half the work is done then and there. You just have to put in the values and tick mark the correct answers now.\nNow about how to attempt. When you start the section, go through the 4 LR sets.1-2 sets will be very easy. Take a couple of minutes and try to identify the easier ones. Look at the questions. Do you see any question wherein it asks how many cases are possible or questions of that sort? Such sets are to be solved at the end. Look for sets wherein directly by looking at the questions, you know that there is one unique solution. Use the answer options to further reduce your time for soling that set. Now start with such sets. First advantage of this method will be that you will feel good, because you will be done with a couple of sets in 10-12 minutes. Additionally you will be in a flow and your chances of cracking a difficult set will go up. Now compare this to the case when you start the section, and think that looking at all the questions means losing a few minutes. I am James Bond, so I will start with the first set. 10 minutes later you haven’t completed a single question and now for the remaining 50 minutes you will keep thinking, yaar 10 min faaltu mein barbaad ho gaye. Good luck solving that section and the next with such a mind-set.\nMany a time it will happen that the set you picked up, is going nowhere and yet time is passing on. For such sets, wherein you have already spent 4-5 minutes but haven’t been able to mark even a single question. Please leave that set.You might be tempted to think sirf 2 min aur, aur phir 4 questions ban jayenge. Please don’t commit that mistake. 5 minutes is the threshold in which you should have been able to mark at least 2 questions. Worst case scenario 1. If you are at 0. Please move on. You are better off solving that set later on,preferably at home!\nSame with DI sets, go through the sets, select the easier ones, and complete them. You will be left off with 2 sets. Again with 2 options, it always easy to select the easier one. This way most of the times, you will end up solving the toughest set at the end or you will probably leave it. All questions have the same marks, so isn’t it better to solve easier ones? Additionally tougher problems will also take a toll on your brain, your effectiveness for the next section might go down. Do you want that to happen?\nSometimes a set will be easy but a question in there will be extremely tough.Beware of such questions, these are put in place to derail your momentum. 5-7 minutes per set is what you should be looking at. Always look at the questions and attempt. You don’t have to attempt all questions from a set. Even 3 attempts for a set is fine. Again, you know the term that I am talking about!Keep that aside when attempting a mock.\nF3.) VA -> Verbal Ability\n\nI get tired of reading and lose interest quickly. So RCs at the end seems a bad idea. So, I start off with RCs. Again as soon as you start this section. Glance through all the RCs in a minute and check if any of them is from a subject you like. Your reading speed and comprehension will be higher in this case. Again as mentioned above, just because you read an RC, doesn’t mean you have to attempt all the questions. Even 4 out of 6 questions from an RC is good enough. Just attempting for the sake of increasing attempts is sheer stupidity. Please don’t think ki aree yaar itne marks toh already aa hi rahe hain exam mein. Dusron ko thoda mauka de deta hun -2 leke. Please don’t do that. Eliminate options and then attempt. When in doubt leave. Move on to the single questions after the RCs.\nNote -> For non-CAT mocks which you attempt online.\nFirst and foremost thing is that apart from CAT, most are pen paper based, but at home you attempt online papers for these. Take a few print outs of the OMR sheet and check how many minutes you need for marking the answers. Keep a 5 min buffer for your safety. Let’s say we talk about IIFT. It’s a 2 hour paper in real. However I need 20 minutes just for marking the bubbles. So, there is absolutely no point in attempting the online paper at home for 2 hrs. Submit the test after 100 minutes. Don’t worry if people attempt for 2 hours and your rank is low. Your score in the main exam matters, not in this one. Similarly for SNAP and XAT as well. Form a basic strategy of how you would like to attempt the paper for the 100 minutes(whatever your time is after you have checked marking in the OMR sheet). Like for Snap, I had a strategy of 5-6 minutes for gk then 16-18 minutes for verbal, then 35-40 minutes for LR. Then maths and as soon as it would be 90 minutes after the start, I would mark all the answers. Then solve and again mark in the last 5 minutes. Similarly make your strategy for IIFT, SNAP, XAT, etc. and stick to it.\nG.) How to analyse mock?\n\nThe instant you submit a mock, you will have a score in mind, itna toh banta hai. 1 sec later the page reloads and you see your score and you go, are yaar itne toh 2 section milake hi aa jane chahiye the. This is why analysing the mock is important. You knew a certain score was achievable but your score went down drastically because of silly mistakes. Analysing mocks will take care of such mistakes. Once the solutions and result for a mock are out. First of all check up all the problems which you couldn’t solve. That’s what you have to learn.\nThen look at the time taken by the topper in solving a question. Look at your time. Did you take 200 seconds whereas the topper took 30 seconds? That’s because there is a technique you don’t about. Learn that technique. Write it in your notebook where you write formulas. That was about identifying and learning things which the toppers know. You have to be one of them. Go through the mocks and find such methods. Additionally\nThen there will be a category of questions you were sure of but you somehow used your talent and got it wrong and after looking at the solution you are like aree yaar yeh koi kaise galat kar sakta hai. But as a matter of fact, you did! This will happen mostly in counting problems (Numbers). Even if you had 100 in English in 10 and 12 you will still come to know that you had been using some Grammar rule incorrectly or there is some exception you had no clue about. But, after a -4 you will remember them! You will sometimes come to know that a certain word which you have been using all your life can also be used in a totally different context. Thank You without an exclamation mark? Sarcasm! Oxymoron, alliteration, etc. Learn what these mean. Such mistakes will make sure you remember all these. Sometimes you will take the diameter as the radius and solve. Sometimes 2*3 will become 5 and sometimes 7*19 will become 114. Don’t rush through problems. The paper is set so as to give you enough time. Slow and steady wins the race.\nThen another section in the results shows the % of people who attempted a question and % of people who got it right. You are supposed to attempt the easy ones first, then the average difficulty questions. Finally attempt a few difficult ones or totally leave them out. Here you can check which questions you were supposed to attempt but didn’t. Also the questions which you were supposed to leave but being the Bond that you are, you nonetheless decided to attempt it thereby losing marks and giving others a chance to overtake you. If your family is worth billions of dollars, you could do that, but given that you are still reading this, I doubt it! So whenever you look at such questions, try to think about what was in your mind during the mock which made you do such a thing. Try not to commit the same mistake again.\nYes, I agree all this will take more than 3 hours. Who told you getting into a good B-school was easy?\nH.) Study Material and mocks from which institute?\n\nThe study material from the top 3 institutes namely Time, CL and IMS is mostly the same. I have seen and used it, so use whichever you want, it won’t make a big difference. A few new ones like Hitbullseye and test funda are also coming up. Haven’t used the material by these 2 so can’t comment. In terms of content the level of questions is higher in Time. I mean tougher questions here, so you are better prepared for CAT, but then you could also argue about why put in more effort than required. In CL, the theory and explanations for quant is way better that that in others. Theory for quant is literally non-existent in Time. IMS is good for verbal. As mentioned above, please use that book for LR and also that book for Verbal. I have not mentioned the names of the books, because if you scroll up and check you will then remember the name when you have to tell it to the shopkeeper! That LR book will help make a strong base for you and then completing the LR material from these institutes will give you practise and improve your skills further. For those who keep talking about Arun Sharma, please please please use proper material. Do you really think 1 book is good enough for your CAT preparation and others are stupid who go through all that? If you think you are smart enough and don’t need all that and 1 book is enough. Good Luck with CAT!\nMocks basically tell you where you stand when compared to the toppers in the country. Time has the most no of people attempting its Aimcats. So having that is a must. Next in line, with the maximum no of people attempting the mocks would be CL. After that you have IMS, test funda and all. Aimcats are pretty tough when compared to actual CAT but are extremely important because it gives you a true picture of where you stand and how much more effort you need to put in. CL mocks are close to the CAT level especially in terms of quant. IMS mocks are close to CAT level in verbal. I would suggest Time + CL/IMS. You can however take all the 3 if you want. Or maybe some other institute’s mock series. It’s mostly about practise.\nThe mock questions are mostly the same. It’s just the values that they keep changing every year. Same with the material. Whether you look at the material of this year or that of 5 years ago, you will realise that it’s mostly the same. So, you are better off buying old material from someone or from a secondhand book store. I have uploaded some mocks and some prep material. Here’s the link for that.\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id...\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id...\nI also found some useful material from total gadha. Here’s the link for that\nhttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...\nhttp://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/...\nI.) GD-PI-WAT prep\n\nFrankly speaking, getting a score is easy. This is the tougher part. This requires more hard work because in here, you will be up against the best in the country. Most of the people attending the interviews will come prepared, so here your odds will be higher. So, please work hard for this. GDPI prep as such should be dealt with in a different question. So, won’t go into the details here, but just an over view of what is expected of you. If you had done the GK and current affairs part as mentioned above, you will be easily able to manage the WAT. You will also have ample of points for speaking in a GD. Similarly questions on current affairs in a PI will also be a piece of cake for you. What remains is the HR part. In here, you have to understand that you can guide the interview and you can force them to ask exactly what you have prepared. But that requires a little thinking. Tell me about yourself is a standard question which is used to initiate an interview. It is mostly followed by your strengths and weaknesses. The main thing here is that you have to try to make a story and link everything that you have done in your life till now with why you want to do an MBA. The interviewers are smart people, they have been doing this for years. They are extremely good at catching liars. So think this through well. This part of your prep needs your utmost dedication and hard work. Prepare your answers properly. It is really tough to explain how to prepare for GD-PI. You will be better off at some institute where someone can guide you individually. However, what I can still do is upload all the GDPI material that I have and share it with you. But do keep one thing in mind, this contains some files on the current affairs of 2015, so that will be of no use for you. The other stuff is pretty much relevant. Here’s the link for that.\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id...\nI hope you convert your dream college.

This post is dedicated to “Avoiding Mistakes” strategy.\nMyth & Mistake-1: Following the Herd. Choosing a help or any coaching because others are choosing it\nHumans belongs to Animal kingdom. If you have studied Biology, then this point will be easier to understand. In animal kingdom. Weak animals are always in herd but the strong one is solitary or always having small groups. Ever wondered Why??\nThe answer lies in the mentality. A strong animal judges the situation and leads its life based on its experience but a weak animal actions are based upon others. If others are doing it, then it’s wise to do it. You can choose to be a Herd follower or to make your own paths.\nNever follow the group. A leader never follows. If you will move with a group, you will always be with them. If you will create your paths, then only you can beat others. Adding following lines from Robert Frost to add a dramatic touch:\n“Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”\nMyth & Mistake-2: Focusing on absolute number of Successful Candidates rather than Percentage.\nMost of the Institutes talks about the number of success stories but are silent on how many of their students were unsuccessful. Even their Advertisements talks about total number of students getting Interview call or final admits. But the real numbers are shocking, most of the Institutes have 2-3 % students getting expected result.\nBut the magic is in numbers. Make people follow a Herd and even if 2-3% students are successful, the success numbers become substantial. The problem is that your chances of landing in the unsuccessful students group is 98%, but this data does not bother them because they know how to work upon the “Herd Mentality” of the population. Show them 2% success stories and make them follow a herd.\nMyth & Mistake-3: The Bigger the Better.\nI am referring to Class Strength. No teacher can teach a herd. If your batch size is more than 10-12 students, then you are not getting proper attention from a teacher. If the education company is claiming “Customized or Personalized” services, then the class size must be less than 10-12 students.\nMyth & Mistake-4: Going after a Brand or No.1 education company\nAll Branded books are easily available in the market at very low-cost. A student joins any help or coaching to get a personalized teaching experience. A Teacher-Student relation is analogous to a Mother-Child relation. There is nothing called “No. 1 Mother”. Every mother is No. 1 for her Kids and the reason is her personalized attention.\nRather than sitting in a large group with “No. 1”, you should aim for a personalized attention (We join any help for their teachers or their course offering).\nMyth & Mistake-5: Deciding after taking Demos\nAll Institutes stage their Demos. They are very carefully planned. The teacher is usually the teacher, who will not teach regularly. If anyone says “Book your demo” or guide you to a specific time, then it is staged. The best way is to ask them about their class timings and insist on sitting in the ongoing class. If you feel the focus is on you, then you are at the wrong place.\nTry to identify honest institutes. Honesty should be a very important deciding factor.\nMyth & Mistake-6: Choosing Institute which makes “Toppers” or just focuses on “Past Records”\nNever choose any institute if its marketing is focused on this fundamental. Keep your basics simple. Think what you want from it and focus on its delivery. You are there for education, not to hear its past stories.\nInstitutes focus on this factor to take your attention away from their product. Your focus should only be on their product, their teachers, their teaching methodologies, their course structures, etc.\nMyth & Mistake-7: Jo Dikhta hai, Wo (Nahi) Bikta hai\nA good product needs no marketing. Weak products need marketing. Whenever you see lots of marketing effort, Google ads, ATL or BTL, it proves that the product is weak. Strong product does not need for all these advertisements. In the marketing world, out of 4Ps, the product is supreme. Focus on “Product”.\nMyth & Mistake-8: Marketing Gimmick-CAT/GMAT Toppers as Teachers\nThis is the most commonly used marketing tool, which has a flawed assumption. Now I am talking more of “Critical Reasoning” language. The flawed assumption is “All Toppers are good Teachers”. Teaching needs a very different skill set. The teaching is to impart knowledge; all toppers cannot be good teachers and all good teachers cannot be toppers.\nMyth & Mistake-9: Institutes offering Patented Techniques or “Tips & Tricks”\nAll tests require “Hard Work”. If someone can patent “Hard-work”, then this “Gimmick” should be accepted. “Tips & Tricks” are developed with your hard-work. Shortcuts should be evolved and should never be learnt from someone else. Particularly for CAT/GMAT, which is more of an IQ test, “Techniques, Tips & Tricks” should be evolved.\nMyth & Mistake-10: CAT/GMAT will take me to Harvard\nThis point is more applicable to business schools taking GMAT as a screening tool.\nThe student’s full profile will work. The CAT/GMAT is a one small part of the profile. Look at all business schools as a family, no family will allow you to be their part till the time they see their values or virtues in you. Every Business school has a distinct positioning and your profile should be positioned in the same way. Profile building is the main work and every person should concentrate on.\nMyth & Mistake-11: Adopting Toppers Strategies\nHear everyone, but adopt none. Every person develops his own ways depending upon his Strengths & Weaknesses or as per his conditions. Good for someone may not be good for you. Hear everyone, but adopt only wisely.\nMyth & Mistake-12: Practice-More the merrier\nPractice Better, Not More. The practice should have a direction, running in circles will not help. Do Tests and review. Keep error Logs and keep on practicing. Practice wisely, so that every time you move, you should learn from your past mistakes. Do not overdo the tests.\nMyth & Mistake-13: Teachers will make me a Topper\nTeachers show us directions. Unless you practice the topics taught in the class, it will not work. I saw many students thinking that if they spend more time in classes, it will help.\nMyth & Mistake-14: All tests just needs lot of studying, no need to focus on health\nHealthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. I see many students not focusing on their health during exams. Many of the studious people have unhealthy bodies. You need to balance life with at least 7-8 hours’ sleep.\nMyth & Mistake-15: I do not need any peer group\nYou learn more from peers than the teachers. The most important factor will be jealousy. Competition in the group brings the best out of you. I was very fortunate that all others in my group were good. They have already scored more than 700 in prep tests. Every test was like a world war where every one of us wanted to beat everyone else in the group.\nMyth & Mistake-16: I will study and practice from lot of free materials on net\nBeware of free materials. There is no free lunch. Some free materials are good, but most of it is crap. The real test is different from the Free tests you see on the net. You will be caught off-guard if you are preparing from the net material.\nMyth & Mistake-17: Beware from 30-day toppers, 15-day toppers\nThis is the most common way of advertisement. Become a topper in 30 days or 15 days. It’s hilarious. This is a perfect example of fraud marketing. The CAT/GMAT is an IQ test. Only Asterix magic potion can do it and nothing else.\nMyth & Mistake-18: You can deceive GMAT Computer Adaptive Algorithm\nPlease do not try. GMAC has evolved a test which cannot be deceived. Every question can carry you “Up” and throw you “Down”. Each question is important and has the same value as others do.\nOne more myth is when a student believes that difficult questions carry more marks. And easy questions weightage is low. Do not read too much into any strategy. Work hard and it will show.\nOne more mistake is trying to gauge your performance by counting correct questions out of total. This is the reason why the GMAC computer algorithm is difficult to copy.\nIf you see easy questions, you are not doomed. It does not necessarily mean that your test is not going well.\nMyth & Mistake-19: Quantitative is important, Engineers have an advantage\nEngineers do not have any advantage in this test. Rather, they are at a disadvantage because their strength (Quant.) does not have substantial weightage. I have seen many students crossing 700 with 40 in quant and Q40 can be achieved by more than 80% of the test givers.\nMyth & Mistake-20: I am good in English, verbal will be kids play\nVerbal is not English, verbal is all about IQ. The only portion of the grammar it touches is SC. But the way CAT/GMAT tests your grammar is more based on IQ rather than grammar rules. SC is more about identifying the wrong choices rather than the correct one. It depends upon how easily you can see 2-3 splits and apply logic to find the correct answer.\nIn CAT/GMAT, there is no perfect answer, you must mark the “Most” correct answer. There might not be any perfect answer in the five choices.\nYour choices should be based on your experience and how a help will help you cover your shortcomings. I found EduShastra customized approach much better than others. I also found their teachers dedicated to their students.']"
How do I prepare myself for CAT?,100+ Answers,['CAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nHow do I prepare myself for CAT?'],"['A step-by-step guide\nGo online, google CAT Online Preparation.\nClick on the second link - one that says online.2iim.com.\nSign up as free user, try out a few classes\nBe reasonably impressed and say “I am going to see what the reviews say about online coaching”\nGo online and google “CAT Online coaching review”.\nCheck out this link What is your review of 2IIM Online CAT Preparation?\nGo to Online CAT Coaching and CAT Preparation: Crack CAT 2016 and start preparation.\nI run 2iim and we guys here believe that CAT preparation should be fun and not overwhelming. That explains the first part of this post. :-)\nOn a more serious note, check out the online options. We are in 2016 and the good online products are streets ahead of classroom variants. Check out a few and take the best one available ( Hint: The website will say 2IIM).', 'The following article describes the way I prepared for CAT (2016). This strategy worked for me and hopefully it works for all you guys as well.\nWARNING!!! – This is a pretty lengthy but descriptive article so those who don’t have the time, maybe you can come read this later!\nI started preparing seriously from the month of March. So here it goes:\nMarch – May: PRACTISE, PRACTISE PRACTISE!!!\nI dedicated this period to work on the “Fundas” and getting conceptual clarity on various topics.\nBefore I get onto what I did, I just want to say that if any of you out there want to sign up for an online or offline course where all the necessary Fundas are taught well – then please visit 2IIM’s official website. This is by far the best place to get all your basics right.\nHere is the link: http://www.2iim.com/\nThe director of 2IIM, Rajesh Balasubramanian himself is an alumni from IIM-Bangalore and to put it in simple words – his style of teaching and more than anything his articles and blogs are AMAZINGG!!\nComing back to the main content, my advice to those of you who are just starting your prep will be: focus on practicing as many questions as you can. This is not the time to take full length MOCK CATs.\nQuant: I had bought TIME material, so I just stuck onto those. Those books are very good and give enough practice for any serious aspirant. The TIME material consists of 3 types of exercises: Conceptual Review, Exercise-(a), and Exercise-(b). So, I solved each and every problem from the TIME books and I feel this is very important because this is when one becomes familiar with all the different types of Quant problems that are likely to come in the actual CAT.\nDI/LR: Again, to prepare for this section, it takes a lot of practice. So just practice all the problems that are there in the TIME material. When I started solving DI/LR problems, I somehow found that I was able to solve LR problems easier than DI. But the truth is, I feel DI problems are easier to score as once you figure out how to get the answer (which will take less time than in LR), you will invariably get it. Also, the main thing in DI is understanding the given data as quickly as possible and figuring out a way to get a solution with the given data. A similar thing holds good for LR problems as well.\nAnother important thing is, DO NOT use the online calculator for every tiny bit of calculation when solving DIs. You can use it for some end-calculations where there is a complicated division or so involved.\nVA/RC: This section is something that many engineering aspirants tend to under-prepare. As far as the English section is concerned, it requires consistent practice and the fruits of your efforts can be seen only much later, unlike the other two sections. For RC, the only way to do well is to develop a good reading habit. So, even if you have never had a reading habit, it’s high time you start because RC is all about comprehension. The ability to look out for what is important even as you read will come only when you keep reading. Also, your reading speed will improve only with practice. So while reading RCs, the strategy is to make a mental 1-line summary of every passage, as you read. So once you start answering the questions, you know which passage to go and look at while referring the RC. I figured out these things from Rajesh Balasubraminan’s blog and articles.\nHere are some of his links:\nhttp://catscores.2iim.com/\nhttp://iimcat.2iim.com\nVA section is again only practice. This section has various types of questions like Para-Jumbling, Sentence Correction, Fill in the blanks question, etc. Again, practice literally every single problem there is in the TIME material. That is the only way the next couple of months of your CAT prep will go on smoothly.\nThe essence of what I want to say is solve every single problem in the TIME material. To do that you have to frame a schedule. Back-work and figure out a schedule that you can stick on to so that you will be able to finish all the TIME materials before May. You can divide months into weeks and divide weeks into days and plan what you’ll be doing every day, so that it finally adds up till May. One important thing is to plan a realistic schedule. And by that what I mean is if there are 30 days in a month, don’t plan something for all the 30 days. Keep like a buffer of 5-6 days of nothing, so that if anything spills over from the other days, you can use your buffer days for finishing what you had scheduled.\nJune-August: ACCURACY\nThis is a good time to start taking your full-length MOCK-CATS. I followed AIMCATs. The whole of Internet is filled with stories of how AIMCATs are much harder than actual CAT. But, personally I never felt so. AIMCATs are approximately of the same difficulty level as the actual CAT. So, take them seriously.\nQuant: I wanted to get even more practice for all the topics, so I spent about 2 months finishing the Arun Sharma book: LOD-I and LOD-II. I feel Arun Sharma’s Quant book is amazing and it will be useful if you get to practice from this book. So if you have the time, then go ahead and finish solving this book also.\nDI/LR ,VA/RC: If you are done solving the TIME material, then you should start solving sectional tests that any coaching centre offers. I followed TIME for this. Their sectional tests are good and plenty. I was never able to finish all the tests for any of the sections. But keep doing it till the D-Day.\nAccuracy is everything so it’s really important to know the right way to analyse your MOCKs. You can find more detailed explanations on Rajesh Balasubramanian’s blogs. But here’s a gist of what I followed:\nRe-Solve the entire paper.\n· Make a note of the type of mistakes that you make. I used to tabulate them in an Excel sheet (to make it interesting)\nFor example:\no Conceptual Mistakes – because you didn’t know how to do that problem ->Again make a note of the solution.\no Silly Mistakes -> Make sure the number of silly mistakes keep reducing with each MOCK\no Questions you shouldn’t have attempted -> some questions are too hard/tricky – you should be able to make that judgement before you attempt.\no Questions you should have answered, but you didn’t.\n· There are some types of questions that repeatedly appear in your MOCKs and have also appeared in previous CAT papers.\no Ex: Some English words – add them to your vocab list and keep revising them everyday\no Some types of Quant problems like – lying milkman, mixtures, compound-to-simple interest ratios.\nMake a note of such things and revise them everyday.\nAlso, DO NOT keep comparing your percentiles with other people or your immediate previous percentile. Your performance must be measure over a period of time and generally AIR ranks give a better measure of where you stand in the country.\nSeptember-November: STRATEGY & CONCEPTS\nThis period is extremely crucial and can be very nerve-racking. This is the time when you’ll have to slowly start forming a strategy as to how you will be answering the questions (in which order and how much time). I followed the following strategy:\nVA/RC: I decided that I would answer all the RC questions first and then only do VA section. Since, invariably more number of questions were for RC section in my MOCKs. The CAT-2016 pattern was such that the exact number of questions in each section was not known. But I went with the strategy of spending 2/3rd of the time for RC (40mins) and 1/3rd for VA (20mins).\nDI/LR: Between DI and LR, I had decided that I would do DI first and then LR. In DI, I decided I would do the easiest DIs first. Then I would do the easiest LRs. After this, I should have solved approximately 2 DIs and 2 LRs. Then if I have time, I would go back to the DI section to the DIs that can be done but will take a little more time to do. If there is time even after this (which is very unlikely), I will do the remaining questions from the respective sections.\nQuant: In this section I decided to spend half the time to literally solve all the very easy problems in the section. There will be at least 10-12 very easy/easy level problems, which you can do and which you should do. Then, in the remaining half of the time, whichever questions I knew how to do, but would take a little time to solve, I did those problems. And during the first half, I would ‘Mark for Review’ the problems which I should do for the second half.\nDepending on the difficulty level, you should solve anywhere between 20(if section is hard)-30(if section is easy) questions per section to get 98+ or 99+ percentile.\nDay before CAT: BE POSITIVE!\nQuite honestly, there is not much preparation that you can do on this day. So just relax! Spend time with people who will encourage you and will make you feel good about yourself. And whatever you do make sure your morale is up and you stay positive. Also, make sure you keep a check on all the important stuff that you need for your exam the next day. Try to get a good sleep! ;)\nD-Day: TRUST YOUR EFFORTS AND BE EVEN MORE POSITIVE!\nDON’T go late to the exam centre! The last thing you need is feeling tensed about the small things. Remember to feel good about yourself and your efforts. The more you believe in your efforts, the greater are the chances that you will score well. Also, keep telling yourself that none of your efforts will ever go waste so just have faith in yourself and be positive!\nIf you’ve reached the end of this article, well I got to say: Thanks for taking the time to read and hope this gives you direction for your CAT preparation. All the best for all the aspirants!\nWith that said, I’d like to mention that I had got 96.72 percentile in CAT-2016. As far as I can remember, I attempted 29 questions in VARC, 15 in DILR (it was the hardest section) and 15 in Quant(I messed up my time management a little).\nMy goal was to do PhD in one of the IIMs and get into teaching and management research. So I had applied for the doctoral programme at IIM - A,B, C. This programme is called FPM - Fellow Programme in Management. Will write an article on FPM and how to prepare for it very soon. Most of the entrance exam scores can be used to apply for this. I chose CAT as I wanted to keep my options open - in case I didn’t get FPM, I thought of pursuing MBA.\nI am currently pursuing FPM in IIMB in the area of Marketing.', ""Scoring high in CAT examination is a prerequisite to get admitted in any of the prime MBA institutes of India. About 2 lacs aspirants appear for CAT examinations. Understandably, competition is very steep.\nThe CAT exam is generally conducted in November each year. You are entitled to appear for the CAT exam if you are a graduate or in the final year of a bachelor’s degree. The CAT exam is a computer-based exam, which consists of the following three sections:\nVerbal and Reading Comprehension (VRC)\nData Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DI & LR)\nQuantitative Ability (QA)\nTips on Preparing for CAT exam\nCAT aspirants should always commence early in preparing for the exams as an early start would suffuse them with an all out knowledge and strategy to go about the examination.\nEnglish reading , comprehension & Maths reasoning , logical skills are to be primary focus areas in order to cross the hurdle of CAT exams and get admitted in your dream MBA institute.\nReading extensively (be it any news paper, magazines, journals, novels) will give that extra edge to get over the reading and comprehension section in CAT examination. Repeated Maths practice will make you a pro, and you will pass with flying colours in the CATS maths section. There are never long equations in CAT, the only thing which works is the smart way of calculations which can be mastered by practicing the tricks available in books and internet.\nYou must associate yourself with the people who have successfully cracked the CAT exams and imbibe confidence and take useful tips from them. CAT students should look at questions from previous years' CATs and understand its syllabus.\nA mandatory part of your CAT preparation would be to take online mock tests and sharpen your abilities, ideas and timing as far as taking on the examination is concerned. In this context you should asses the mock test results and work on your shortcomings before taking the final plunge.\nManaging one's time includes balancing speed with accuracy, handling the pressure and uncertainty and the apt decision making.learning to allocate time while answering to various sections of the CAT exam paper is very essential. It is so since you need to finish the paper on time with almost all the correct answers to score maximum.\nNegative marking is a part of CAT. Aspirants are advised to not take wild guesses in the Exam paper. Only if the student is able to eliminate 2-3 choices, then he should take a guess. Otherwise there is no point in wild guessing, as it may drop ones chances of making it right.\nYou must unwind before the exams. Over stressing can have negative impact on your output during the examination. Be your natural self and confident. Keep calm and cool. You must be aware of your examination centre before hand, all the documents, stationeries you need to produce at the centre should be kept handy so that trifle mismanagement may not unnerve you.\nDoing well in the CAT exam is the first step to ensuring that you get the education to build a great future. It involves a lot of hard work and is one of the most difficult competitive exams. But with right kind of focus and determination you are sure to be successful in cracking CAT.\nI hope you had a good read. All the best for your exams.

I cleared CAT 2013 and got into IIM Kozhikode and was working alongside while I was preparing. I’ll help you understand how I did and you can use it to similarly design your preparation schedule. This is how I was managing my weekdays-\n1. 5:30 AM: Up from Bed\n2. 6:00- 8:00/8:30 : CAT preparations\n3. 9:30-6:30 : Office\n4. 6:30-9:30: Relax and do miscellaneous things\n5. 10:00-10:45: Revise learnings from the morning hours\nWeekends\nSaturday: Answer Mocks\nSunday: Review Mocks thoroughly\nI would highly recommend you to setup a schedule for yourself and stick to it. Each day will help you build on your preparations.\nAs you can see, I had a packed schedule and which kept me away from those long classroom coaching sessions. As an alternate source for preparation, I joined Handa ka Funda Online CAT Coaching Classes - MBA 2016 which is an online platform with no time constraints. It made me stick to my schedule and help me prepare really well.\nHaving sorted out your schedule and also being enrolled in the online coaching , you need to emphasize on practising questions intensively. Please stress on those areas where you feel you need to improve. That’s the key to achieving that extra percentile at the top.\nProtip: While CAT concepts do have short cuts, success does not. The key is always hard work and practice.\nDo well !\nTips for Working Guys:\n CAT is difficult to be managed with job but it has to be done (leaving a job for cat is too risky considering the unpredictability of the exam).\n Assumptions for below :\n 1. Total of 10-11 hours outside home (office + travel to/fro office)\n 2. Sat & Sun Weekend off\n In case any of the assumptions are not valid in your case, try to accommodate the points as per your schedule.\n 1. Give equal importance to all the 3 sections. Do not live under the veil that you can cover one section with another. It is difficult to do. Considering the unpredictability of VA and high difficulty level of DILR, focus on all the sections.\n 2. Daily news-paper reading (Hindu/Economic Times).\n 3. Daily VA practise from old mocks/sectionals. (IMS - all, Time - leave RCs, Cl - leave RCs)\n 4. Daily DILR practise from old mocks/sectionals. (IMS, CL, Time - all)\n 5. Daily QA practise from old mocks/sectionals. (IMS, CL, Time - all)\n 6. On weekdays allocate 6 hrs for studying (2 hrs for each section as told above) & on weekends9 hrs for studying (3 hrs to each section) and 3 hrs for mock and 2 hrs for mock analysis\n 7. Should finish QA theory and formulas by July/Aug.\n 8. From Aug/Sep onwards only revision and mocks and sectionals.\n 9. Should give atleast 2 mocks each weekend and their analysis. Should give all centre based mocks from centre itself to be prepared for all exam scenarios.\n 10. Last month (assuming Nov) : 1 mock each day and its analysis\n 11. Take an off atleast 1 week before the exam and give mocks at exam time.\n 12. Sneak in time for your hobbies during the preparation.\n Happy Prepping !! Don't overstress.

How was the CAT 2018?,45 Answers,['Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExams and Tests\nHow was the CAT 2018?'],"['Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.\nOriginal Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.\nBut the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.\nQuant was relentless\nThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar to\nAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?\nWherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.\nFirst principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.\nVARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easier\nVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.\nDILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.\nPercentile Ranges - Expected\nKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following ranges\nVARC - similar to CAT 2017\n99.5th percentile plus - 73+\n99th percentile – 66\n97th percentile – 60\n94th percentile – 54\n90th percentile – 50\n80th percentile – 40\nDILR - Also similar to CAT 2017\n99.5th percentile plus - 52+\n99th percentile – 42\n97th percentile – 37\n94th percentile – 30\n90th percentile – 24\n80th percentile – 20\nQuant - a step above what was seen in CAT 2017\n99.5th percentile plus - 54+\n99th percentile – 43\n97th percentile – 38\n94th percentile – 35\n90th percentile – 29\n80th percentile – 23\nOverall for CAT 2018\n99.5th percentile plus - 160+\n99th percentile – 140\n97th percentile – 127\n94th percentile – 115\n90th percentile – 100\n80th percentile – 75\nOnce again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.\nBest wishes for the results, folks.', 'Since the paper and the official answers are out, let me start with my scores in CAT18 (Slot 2)\nVerbal - 66\nDILR - 78\nMaths - 86\nTotal - 230\nIf I get a 100%ile it will be the 5th time in CAT.\nAbout myself:\nI am a Faculty who trains students fot Maths and DILR section.\nI have taken CAT number of times and my past performance is as follows\n100%ile (4 times) - 2007, 2009, 2016, 2017\n99.99%ile - 2015\n99.98%ile - 2008, 2011, 2014\nI usually write the exam to learn something, and there is a lot of learning from every CAT exam I write. The idea of this post is to list down my learnings.\nMy last two years score cards are as follows\nBefore going to the paper, the review of the first slot was that Verbal was simple, DILR was also relatively easy as compared to last year. Maths was really tough.\nBut over the years I have realised that whatever you listen to - ensure that you go with the flow of the paper and avoid predicting the paper.\nVerbal:\nHow I wrote the paper?\nWhen I started the paper, the language for the initial RCs was simple, but questions were tricky. Wasted a lot of time on the initial few questions. Then I realised my teaching to the studens, not to waste time on questions. Just mark what you feel is the answer after eliminating the options and move ahead. Though I followed the process still it did take time. Just finished the paper in time with a little haste in the last para jumbles. In the previous attempts I usually have 5 to 10 minutes in the end after I have gone through all the questions.\nPerformance:\n66 score in this paper looked fine. I am anyways not strong in Verbal. Did not have a good feeling with regards to Verbal. But considering that I have scored 99.9x%ile in verbal section in CAT15 and CAT16, I believe could have scored better.\nLearnings from the paper:\nDid a mistake of overthinking in the initial part of the paper. This ensured that I had to hurry in the parajumbles, which resulted in 3 out of the 4 parajumbles going wrong.\nI have realised over the years that when I read regularly before the exam I score better in Verbal. Last year and this year I have not been reading regularly. That is clearly reflected in lower scores in Verbal.\nDILR:\nHow I wrote the paper?\nI have scored 100%ile in the last 2 attempts in this section. Last year had attempted 8 sets whcih was a difficult section. Review was that this year the paper was easy. So was confident of solving 8 sets. First set was not so simple. took some time, but after some effort was able to complete the set. Second set had a lot of calculations. I built the complete framework on the paper. Could answer one question. But for solving others I had to do a lot of calculations. Was feeling lazy and I completely forgot about calculator. So skipped it and went to the next set. Now I had 2 minds if I could really solve all sets. So decided to pick easy sets and solve. Glanced through all sets and started picking up sets that I felt could have been done in short span of time. Was able to solve 5 more sets and with around 10 mins left I had 1 more set to go through and the 2nd set whcih I was not able to solve. I went to the 2nd set and was able to solve it. That left little time for the last set. Went through the set and solved 3 questions based on my understanding of the set.\nPerformance:\n78 is one of the highest score in this section this year. So should be able to get a 100%ile in this section third year in a row. I had total 31 out of 32 questions attempted with 4 answers wrong. 1 was in the last set which I did not solve properly. 1 where I solved it correct and marked it wrong. 2 questions from a single set where I was confident about the answer, but did some silly mistake. Overall did feel happy after the section as I was able to keep my head.\nLearnings:\nDont go purely based on prediction. Heard a lot of student panicked in DILR in 2nd slot as they had expected a relatively easy paper after the feedback from the first slot but turned out to be not so easy.\nWas prudent enough to leave 2nd set at that moment. Important to leave questions that are difficult as fast as possible to spend time on easy sets.\nMaths:\nHow I wrote the paper?\nMy previous year attempt in this section was that I had solved all questions but had 3 silly mistakes which resulted in score of around 90. The review was that the paper was much tougher than last year. So back of my mind I was prepared for solving lesser number of questions. But decided to solve the paper as it comes. I was able to solve the initial questions, but realised that I was taking too much time cross checking the answers as I heard the paper was tough. I realised that was a mistake. So stopped cross checking the answers and went full fledged with solving the paper as fast as possible. I did not face any hiccup in the paper. Only 1 question I left in between as I thought it will take extra time. Finished all the questions with 8 minutes to spare. Came back to that 1 question ans solved it. So with 6 minutes to spare I solved the entire paper.\nPerformance\n86 is a decent score, but could have done better. 34 attempts with 4 wrong. 2 questions I solved it correctly but marked the wrong answer. For 2 questions I used the correct method but did some silly mistake.\nLearnings:\nDon’t try to predict the paper. Go with the flow of the paper.\nIt is easy to solve a CAT paper without using Formulae or Equations.\nTips for preparation for CAT\nFor Verbal reading is the key to imporve. Read what you like and enjoy reading. Over a period of time you can read from diverse areas.\nFor DILR what is important is to build your ability in logic. Don’t only focus on CAT books but look at solving puzzles from different sources. Learning the right approach to solve DILR questions could boost your scores.\nI believe this is the area where a lot of students prepare incorrectly and hence are not able to do well in the exam. CAT exam does not test you on pure mathematics, but on how can you think logically. I have put up solution on youtube for CAT17 questions where I solved all questions with as far as possible not using exotic equations or formulae.I will do that for CAT18 too. These methods are quite simple and I have quite a few non engineers apart from engineers who perform really well in the exam using these methods. Expecting a few 99.8+%iles from my students.', 'Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam Analysis\nThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines.\n 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section.\n 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well.\n 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years\n 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.\nCAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension\nQuestion Structure\n Reading Comprehension: 24 questions\n 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)\n Parajumbles: 4 questions\n Odd one out: 3 questions\n Summary: 3 questions\nAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions.\n Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.\nSo, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.\nSummary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.\nCAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation\nQuestion Structure\n There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.\nA total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.\nAs far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced.\n In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section.\n In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016.\n In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017.\n If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.\nSummary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.\nCAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative Aptitude\nQuestion Structure\n Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it.\n Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions.\n There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).\nA total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.\nSummary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.\nExpected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 Exam\nTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam\n Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions\n Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions\n Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questions\nFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam\n To get 90%ile 35-37 questions\n To get 95%ile 42-44 questions\n To get 98%ile 48-50 questions\n To get 99%ile 53-55 questions\nWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam. It would be great if you can fill that out: CAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Expected Cutoff and Percentile Mapping', 'CAT 2018, as many others have written here, was a beauty!\n25th November:\nThis was my second attempt and I got lucky this time to be allotted my preferred slot, the Forenoon slot. The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.\nSection 1: VARC\nVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 percentile in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.\nSection 2: DILR\nThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.\nSection 3: QA\nThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.\nI went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.\n30th November:\nIIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various keys in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.\n7th December:\nIIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!']"

Have a nice day."", ""In December 2013, I joined CAT classroom program at IMS Deccan for CAT 2014. Had a decent experience. Like you mentioned the faculty members are good. Diwakar Sir is excellent. I attended most of the classes. The notes are great. And although I didn't take any mock tests, I've had people tell me, that the mocks are pretty close to CAT. Anyway, due to some unavoidable reasons (A story for some other time), I didn't take CAT that year.\nNext year, December 2014, I was thinking of joining a coaching institute for CAT 15, as I had lost touch, and had to start with the basics. I thought of joining IMS again as they were offering me some loyalty discount. Around 30%. I wasn't thinking straight at that time. Thankfully, I have a close friend who talked some sense into me, at that time. He told me it was useless attending the same lectures (where they would discuss the same handouts) again, when you've attended most of them. So even if you have to pay more, it makes more sense to join TIME. And I joined TIME Deccan for CAT 2015.\nI attended all the lectures. Took around 20 mocks out of 25. The faculty which I had, were equally good. And the notes are good. Mocks are excellent (Read more difficult than the actual CAT)\nThe only difference I felt was that the quality of students at TIME was much better. At IMS I had around 15 people in my class. At TIME I had around 40 people. But that pushed me a little. To try and answer questions in class, faster than the others. The atmosphere was competitive. This is what lacked at IMS. It was more interactive at TIME. And the quant faculty used to push us for solving questions faster. I don't remember him solving a lot of questions on the board.\nIt could be that the experience that I had at TIME, might not be the same for everyone. The way they teach varies with the faculty members. I know some faculty members solve everything on the board. Remember, this method is suitable for many people. A lot of people in my class used to complain sometimes of the faculty member being too fast. A lot of people want the solutions to be written on the board.\nApart from this i don't see any difference between IMS Deccan and TIME Deccan.\nSO was my decision right? To go with TIME for CAT 2015? FOR ME, YES!\nEdit : I cannot comment on CL, or for that matter any of the online coaching websites, as I have no experience with them."", ""For any aspirant, the following factors are of prime importance when it comes to joining a coaching institute:\n\n1. Personal attention - I think the most important factor is this. If personal attention and mentoring is missing, don't join. When you are evaluating institutes, go and check their classrooms for batch size. Ask for a demo session, if possible.\n\n2. Faculty - In addition to point 1, look for people who have gone through the whole process as they can understand you better and guide you better. Ask for faculty details. See if you can talk to them.\n\n3. Content/Material/mocks - Don't think this is a differentiating factor these days because almost every coaching institute is giving more or less the same content and volume of the content. But look for institutes where content is getting frequently updated to match the recent trends. As I said, not a differentiating factor. Mocks used to be a differentiating factor, but a lot of online players are offering free mocks now.\n\n4. Location - You should be in a position to reach the coaching institute easily so that you don't spend time traveling. Becomes very important in the months of August-November.\n\n5. Course coverage and fees - I personally think the big established players are charging way too much for what they are offering. I have stopped recommending the big institutes for this reason. Considering exam fees and institute applications, a serious candidate will easily spend 15-20,000 INR. Don't see the point of spending around 40,000 on a coaching institute just to feel good that you are doing something and gather material which you are never going to solve.\n\nIn essence, to any aspirant, my recommendation is: Look for all these factors. Don't fall for marketing gimmicks like 'India's number 1 trainer/coaching institute' or '2000+ IIM calls' and see if you are getting more 'value' for the 'cost' being incurred. Ask for more. You are worth it.\n\nDisclaimer: I run a CAT coaching institute with some of the best brains I have seen in my life so my suggestion is going to be biased. But I would still like you to consider Learningroots while deciding on a coaching institute. Hope this helps!"", ""To be honest don't go by the brand but go by the amount of effort put by QUALITY teachers behind which is none in TIME / CL or IMS. I would suggest you to attend a trial class. First at TIME, then IMS and then GENESIS MENTORS at Pune.

"During the analysis of my CAT mock, especially for quant, I am able to solve 22-26 questions, but while taking the mock, I am stuck to 10-12 questions. How can I improve?",8 Answers,"['CAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExams and Tests\nDuring the analysis of my CAT mock, especially for quant, I am able to solve 22-26 questions, but while taking the mock, I am stuck to 10-12 questions. How can I improve?']","['Thanks for A2A Gaurang.\nYou need to read the questions fast in the exam hall. Immediately leave the question if you are not sure of how to solve it post the first reading. Do not try to understand by investing more time on it.\nDoing this, run through the paper till the end. You would have selected all easy ones for you and solved them. On this ruthless journey to the end, you should bookmark the questions that you think you can solve but can be time consuming. Get back to these question if time permits.\nIf you follow this basic process, you can get up from 10–12 to 18–20 questions. The key lies in not wasting time on the questions that need to be left - the difficult ones for you. Let me illustrate this doing some basic maths.\nSuppose, you read and double read questions to try to solve them. You read 26 questions - solve 12 and leave 14 after trying to solve them. So, effectively 60/26 => 2.3 minutes per question (assume same time for both solved and unsolved/wrong ones) => 14*2.3 approx 32 minutes wasted.\nSo, the key lies in spending time on those questions which you can solve and immediately leaving the ones that confuse you in the hall. Practice this. Being conscious about fast selection leads to lots of improvement in attempts and accuracy both.\nMy team and I will be discussing mock analysis in details in this free all India mock series for CAT 2018. You can register for this prediction mock series on this link:CAT 2018 Feel CAT Series\nBest wishes!\nRahul Sir\nCAT Coach\nwww.bfactory.in', 'A2A\nThe only difference between solving questions after the test and during the test is the accompanying pressure. When you are taking the test, there are stakes involved: you are probably thinking about the score, accuracy, cut-offs and percentile. There are no such distractions once you are attempting the questions with a clearer mind (also, there is no fatigue as would be the case during the test; attempting quant after those 2 gruelling hours is an arduous task, no doubt) and that generally helps focus a bit better.\nThe best thing you can do in this situation is to think of one question at a time and not the macro picture when you are attempting the test. If you tend to count the number of reds and greens when you are solving a question or are obsessively looking at the timer every 30 seconds or so, you would need to break this habit. The best candidates will invariably tell you that they are confident in their ability and that it is their attempt that will define the level of difficulty and not the other way around (in simpler words, if they are unable to attempt a question after a minute of struggle, they are smart enough to understand that more than 90% of the test-taking population won’t be able to solve it and so, skip it without any second thoughts). The key to doing justice to the test lies in being aggressive and fearless when you are solving every question.\nSo, instead of worrying about your mock scores, use the mocks to get better at the actual test. Read the question carefully, solve it using the first method that comes to your mind (if you got nothing in 45 seconds, move on) and do not make any calculation errors. Repeat this 34 times and you should get a better outcome. Sounds arbitrary but it actually works in most cases when content is not an issue (which, I am assuming is true in your case considering that you are able to solve around 70 percent of the test).\nHope that helps.', 'This is a very normal occurrence for quite a few students.\nIt is very natural. This happens because your mind has already seen all the questions and whether you like it or not, the questions or the roadblocks or their concepts lurk in your mind and then when you solve it again, you seem to solve more.\nIn a mock, you look at the questions for the first time and have to read them, absorb them, calculate, process it for the first time. This means that you need time to read, interpret, comprehend, understand and solve the problem.\nThe way to move over this problem is to practice regularly and continuously. Give sectional tests and mocks frequently. This is because it will improve your retention, comprehension and solving speed and skills.\nIf you ever feel that a particular topic and section is becoming tough and that you are repeatedly making mistakes in it, then the best option is to give sectional tests and practice beforehand wherein you read all the concepts, solve all the questions of all the levels of difficulty.\nFor example, I always feel that geometry and P&C have always been my achilles heel. So, if I ever score low in quant or in LR, I double down from Arun Sharma books and the coaching reference books. This gives me confidence and allows me to go over the concepts once again. The surprising thing I have noticed is that many a times there have been cases where I forget few tips and tricks related to the concepts I have already brushed over. I usually then go beyond the trick, have a look at its reasoning and the method for the trick. For example, for finding remainder I always imagine doing it using the binomial theorem — this is because I can never imagine the other tips and tricks. For the mixtures portion, I always go by the LCM approach — this I do because I cannot visualise or calculate using the tricks. So, I know what works for me or what I am able to use.\nNever stick to one method just because it is easy —- being easy is a very subjective term.\nAll the best!', ""When we come across with any friendly person, we feel very good. We would like to spend as much time with that person. Those individuals just make us feel extremely comfortable. But life is not a bed of roses. Many a times we have to confront individuals, perceived as not so friendly or may be deadly, whose thought processes are totally diametrically opposite ours. The process of interaction with such individuals, at times, can take an ugly shape of confrontation. We may tend to get so emotionally engrossed that the chances of getting almost intellectually paralyzed are very high. Brain just freezes. Mind goes numb. We may not be able to analyze the things objectively -as expected of a rational being. We just want to win our argument at any cost. And when that does not happen, our pride gets battered and bruised badly.\nBut then, time is a great healer. We may have been pained by that individual/situation. But, over a period of time, we tend to forget that and we just move on with our regular daily set of activities. In fact, many a times, the converse happens. When we analyze those situations (when we are in cool frame of mind), the following thought processes tend to resonate.\nOh ! I should not have done that.\nOh ! How silly of me.\nOh ! Why did i behave so inappropriately with that individual. It was just so ungentlemanly of me !\nWell, I think I should have behaved in a proper way.\nEssentially, many a times, when we try and recollect those incidents, we realize that was our own folly. But then, a price has already been paid. We may have lost that individual. But then, it’s life. We will come across with hundreds and thousands of individuals but with mindset different from ours.\nThe fundamental questions are:->\n“Have we really learned enough from that first nasty confrontation so that the same can be avoided later on”. ?\n“Are we sure that we will be able to deal with those so called unfriendly individuals in a better way next time”?\n“Have we really learned from our mistakes “ ?\n“Can we maintain our cool and calm during pressure like scenarios”\nAnd that’s what CAT MOCKs are trying to teach us. The MOCKs are presenting to us lots of situations -some good, some nasty and some utterly disgusting. During the test time, sometimes we are not able to spot a friendly easy question. Instead we tend to spend a lot of time wrestling with a question which should have been ignored on the mere looks of it. But we tend to fight with that during the test time and if we were blessed with infinte time, most likely we would fight with that till eternity.\nIn my last 14 years of coaching for CAT, I had interacted with thousands of CAT aspirants. It is very difficult to say what is a right formula to crack QUANT. What works for one person may not work for the other individual. Everyone is unique. There is no standard formula which can be applied everywhere.\nWhen we are writing MOCKs, there is that huge time pressure. We would have to learn as to how to handle that pressure. When we can maintain cool and calm, our ability to spot easy questions and do those correctly will multiply. Further, we will be effective in identifying torturous qs and ignore those quickly. But this brings forth another key point\n“If we were blessed with excellent time/pressure managment skills, can we do a large number of questions on the basis of those skills alone” ?\nWell, the answer is plain, simple NO.\nSo, the question is what are those other skills which we should be endowed with and what we should do for that.\nThere are some broad pointers/factors which we should be aware of.\nDuring the test time, don’t spend unnecessary amount of time on questions which are difficult. Such questions are meant to be left out. But, Yes !! During preparation stage, one should make a conscious attempt to learn relevant concepts and different techniques for cracking such questions.\nDuring the preparation stage, don’t leave out any chapter completely.\nThere are around 25–26 chapters where the questions have been coming across in CAT for the past 10 years. For the sake of convenience, we can divide the entire CAT QUANT portion in two broad categories -\n1) FRIENDLY areas in QUANT 2) DEADLY areas in QUANT\nFollowing is a hypothetical scenario. Pls note that what appears “friendly” for one may be “deadly” for other.\nFRIENDLY Areas in QUANT (for a candidate X):->\nThere are around 7–8 topics which a candidate X may feel comfortable with. Those topics are 1) Simple Equations 2) Ratio, Proportion, Variation 3) Percentages 4) Profit, Loss, Partnership 5) SICI 6) Averages, Mixtures and Alligations 7) Time & Work 8) Time & Distance. These topics are generally “perceived” to be less painful.\nThere were 14–15 questions from the above mentioned areas in CAT 2017\nIf anyone is out of touch with MATHS, the chances are very high that one will like to focus on ONLY the topics as mentioned above.\nDEADLY AREAS in QUANT(for that candidate X)\nThere are other 15–16 chapters where that canddiate X may not feel comfortable with. These chapters may not appear as friendly as the ones mentioned earlier on. Qs from chapters like 1) Numbers -LCM, HCF, Remainders, etc 2) Geometry 3) Mensuration 4) Special Equations 5) Inequalities 6) Functions & Graphs 7) Coordinate Geometry 8) P&C 9) Probability 10) Indices & Surds 11) Logarithms 12) Trigonometry 13) Number Systems -Binary, Hexadecimal System 14) Quadratic Equations 15) Progressions 16) Statistics are very common place.\nLast year, there were around 19–20 qs from the above mentioned areas.\nIt’s clear that the candidate X has less exposure. The chances are high that he will spend more time on qs which are from his friendly domain. But the number of qs from such areas will be limited in the exam-may be 15. As a consequence, during the test time, the number of attempts will get restricted to less than 15.\nAnd later on we realize that we could have done about 22 qs.\nWhy does that feeling occur.\nBecause, when we are doing that analysis, we are doing in a cool frame of mind. All deadly qs (during the test time) have started appearing friendly (during the analysis time).\nLet me present to you one example. This question is actually related to “Permutation & Combination”. Sometimes, the very mention of this topic can unsettle even a seasoned professional.\nHere goes the question.\n(Difficulty level of the question posed below is left for you to decide for)\nThere are 13 players. Each player plays exactly one match with every other player. Find the total number of matches held.\nAns:->\nWhen we apply P&C, we can get the answer by applying 13C2. Now, when we are not comfortable with the chapter, we may feel like leaving that question during then exam. But there is other way to look at this question -PATTERN METHOD.\nTake the following cases.:\nA, B (Matches held —-> AB)\n3 Persons:-> A, B, C\n(Matches held)\nAB, AC (2)\nBC (1)\nTotal:-> 1+2\n4 Persons:-> A, B, C, D\n(Matches held)\nAB, AC, AD (3)\nBC, BD (2)\nCD (1)\nTotal: 1+2 +3 =6\n5 Persons:-> A, B, C, D , E\n(Matches held)\nAB, AC, AD, AE (4)\nBC, BD, BE (3)\nCD, CE (2)\nDE(1)\nTotal: 1+2 +3 +4=10\nObserving the pattern, we can say that the number of matches held\nMatches = 1+2+3 +4……+12 = 78\nLet’s understand the bigger picture. During the exam, there will be easy qs-like the one above (Matches qs) (from so called difficult chapters).\nSo, how do we spot those. During the preparation phase, we have to solve a large number of qs from various chapters so that we are not taken by surprise. Practice and a never say die attitude matters.\nWe need to keep our mind open. Let’s enter the exam hall with our mind clear of any prejudices. If we can do that, CAT should not be a difficult one to crack.\nYou can follow the link below for additional pointers related to CAT QUANT preparation.\nRajesh Kumar Saraf's answer to What are some of the important tricks used for solving the quants section in the CAT exam?\nAll the best !!""]"

Both are equally good in terms of content. You can choose any mode of learning from these two depending upon some factors like distance of the coaching institute from your place, speed of internet etc. Following are the pros and cons of online and offline course:\nOnline courses:\nFlexible.\n24*7 access to the courses.\nNo travel involved.\nTeaches self discipline.\nVery helpful for working professionals and undergraduates preparing for CAT.\nLack of interaction with fellows.\nPreparation interrupts in case of technical problems.\nClassroom course:\nGuidance and mentorship is not a problem as students meet their mentor regularly..\nPhysical study material.\nMore access to class activities.\nCan interact with fellows.\nInvolves time of traveling.\nExpensive.\nLess flexibility in class scheduling.\nYou have around 14 months which are more than enough to prepare for CAT exam. You can peacefully complete the syllabus, practice questions, write mocks and revise the concepts in these months even if study slowly. The best way to prepare for CAT is going by the plan of action or a strategy of preparation. Before starting the preparation, make a study plan and follow it religiously till the exam.\nIt is required to study 300–500 hours to score a decent percentile. Set some targets like:\nSyllabus completion including practice by May 2019\nRevision - June 2019 to July 2019\nTest series - August 2019 to October 2019\nKeep November 2019 for 3–4 mock tests and complete revision. This revision should include your notes and the important questions from mocks.\nTo make your preparation strategy, you can take help of toppers’ interviews or you can take my inputs:\nUnderstand the Syllabus and Exam pattern:\nThe duration of CAT exam is 3 hours(180 minutes). Number of questions is 100 for 300 marks.\nThere will be 34 questions from Quantitative Ability (QA), 34 from Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), and 32 from Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR).\nThere will be both Multiple Choice Questions and Numerical Answer Type Questions in the exam.\nLearn the Basic concepts:\nEveryone asks us to focus on basics but there is one question which always strikes our mind - Why are basics so important?\nNow think about building a house. If we had all four walls already measured out and put them together against each other. We could make other people think that our house was secure. But once that first strong wind comes, suddenly the house is blown down and nothing is left.\nWhat do we do now? Obviously we will try to rebuild the house. But still the house is secure until the strong wind comes.\nThis whole scenario is much like a CAT aspirant who ignores basics and thinks he/she knows it all. They stay with one topic for a while and then they move on to another topic without learning the basics of the last topics.\nSo now the question arises that what was wrong with the house? We measured the walls properly and built the house in the correct ratio but what should we have done with our house to make it actually secure? First of all it is essential to lay the foundations. Then we build the walls, we add the roof, then we paint it, furnish it, make the outside look good and then live in it.\nIn the same way your CAT preparation must begin with the basics.\nPractice, Practice and Practice:\nOur mind becomes good at the things if we do them repeatedly. Practice a set of question after learning its basics. It will give you a better understanding of the topic. With practice you will gain, accuracy, speed and confidence. Here is a list of recommended books: Recommended and Best Books for CAT Exam Preparation.\nRevise periodically:\nHuman mind has a tendency to forget things in some time. But the good part is that it remembers the things if it sees / hears the things again and again. So to keep the things in mind that you have studied, revise them periodically. Make sure that you revise everything at least 3 times before appearing in the exam.\nWrite mock tests:\nAfter completing around 75% syllabus, start attempting full length tests. After completing a test, analyse it carefully. You will know your weak areas by doing this. Now you have to work more on these areas. Note down your mistakes in a separate notebook so that you do not repeat them again.\nRead, read and read to improve your English part:\nReading books / novels / magazines of your choice will help you in performing better in VARC section. Spare at least 1 hour in reading books. It will build a good vocabulary and enhance grammar skills which will also be helpful in Group Discussion and Personal Interview at the time of college conversion. If you are wondering which books to read, go here: Recommended Books and Novels List that every MBA / CAT Aspirant Should Read.\nHope I helped you. All the best !!', 'You have more than a year time and utilising it religiously will surely help you to crack CAT. Depending solely on books and self-practice wont help you in a productive way, hence relying on an online course will be largely useful.\nA YEAR PLAN:\nEveryday Tasks:\nSpend 30 minutes reading editorials every day from newspapers like The Hindu, Economist, Mint, etc. This will help you in polishing your skills in VA & RC.\nNovels help you a lot in honing your verbal ability. Read a novel for an hour before the bedtime. Start with fiction novels of your own interest genre or else you can prefer authors like Khaled Hosseini, Sidney Sheldon, Jeffrey Archer, etc.\nMake notes of the new words’ meanings, synonyms, and antonyms as well as idioms as you read the editorials and newspapers. Use apps to make notes; this will be beneficial as it will always be with you anytime and anywhere for a revision or reference.\nPolish your basic English Grammar skills. Refer “High School English Grammar and Composition by Wren and Martin.”\nSEPTEMBER 2018 – JANUARY 2019:\nStart preparing for Quant, DI & LR. Learn basic concepts, and practice basic questions.\nI would suggest enrolling in “Handa Ka Funda” online course to ace in all the sections with ease. Refer to the video tutorials for learning the basic concepts as you start picking new topics. The structured method of the course will help you cover all the topics gradually as well as help you learn tips and tricks with respect to them.\nThe following timetable will help you complete all the video tutorials of ‘Handa Ka Funda’ within 2–3 months.\nAlong with the learning through the course spend another 1 hour for practicing questions from books of TMH/Pearson publications with respect to each section.\nOn weekends spend as much as time you can for all the sections including VA & RC. Take RC tests for an hour on weekends.\nFEBRUARY 2019 – APRIL 2019:\nStart taking sectional mocks\nMAY 2019 - SEPTEMBER 2019:\nTake two mocks per week and analyse them to identify your strengths and weaknesses.\nStrive for the best.\nThanks for A2A Md Wasif Alamgir. Hope I helped I you.\nGood Luck!', 'Hello student\nWhat comes out from your question is the fact that you are not into the habit of reading. You need to build efficiency in reading and all three sections will appear better than before.\nRead these topics from wikipedia/google:\nPhilosophy\nPsychology\nArts\nScience\nLiterature\nSociology\nCulture\nEconomics\nFiction\nWhile reading, make sure you keep a track of “What” are you reading. This is called central idea based reading. Also note down contextual meaning of words which trap you. Guess the meaning as per context and then check the real meaning from the dictionary.\nYou can also read some non-fiction and motivation/career oriented novels to begin with - foreign authors. Build volume of reading through novels. You can also refer to daily newspaper editorials for reading points mentioned above.\nReading improves your interpretation abilities. This is the first step to structuring information. Then, the methods that you learn, section wise and topic wise come to your help in getting to the correct answer.\nHope the idea is clear!

How can I prepare for CAT 2017?,100+ Answers,['CAT Preparation 2017\nCAT (Common Admission Test) 2017\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExams and Tests\nHow can I prepare for CAT 2017?'],"['""Many great things can be done in a day IF you don’t always make that day tomorrow""\nA common question troubling MBA aspirants is when to commence with CAT preparation and the answer is NOW\nAs mentioned by many, CAT (Common Admission Test) is one of the toughest exam to crack. It is the gateway to getting into prestigious IIMs and other top B-schools of India. So the very first thing that you should do is:\nUnderstand the syllabus\nThis is a useful tip for almost any exam. Understand the syllabus by going through past year’s papers and official guidelines. All the information about CAT/XAT/NMAT/TISS/MICA/SNAP/CMAT/CET are available on our website www.catking.in .CAT can be segmented into four broad parts-\nQuantitative Ability\nData Interpretation\nLogical Reasoning\nVerbal Ability\nStart your preparation with sheer determination.\nKnow where you stand\nA lot of successful IIM aspirants attribute their success to the efforts put in the last 4-6 months before the CAT. Take the Basic Mock test at Catking to know where you stand. This can then be used as a base to start your preparation for this year.\nShould you join coaching?\nThis is based on a lot of things. If you have a lot of time, you can go for coaching. However, if you are into a hectic job and get very little time to study, you can prepare on your own or you can join online classes. Although Coaching will give you proper guidance on what to prepare, major areas to focus on, strategies to save time and also help in preparing for Group Discussions and Personal Interview. Catking is one of the best Cat classes in Mumbai and Pune. You can register yourself here www.catking.in for free demo lecture.\nBooks and material\nFirst of all, get CAT preparation material of some good coaching institute. You can buy Catking books which are apt and more than sufficient for CAT preparation.\nFor verbal, you also need to read “Word Power made Easy” by Norman Lewis. It is a very good book which helps in increasing vocabulary not by memorising stuff, but by understanding the ideas behind the words. It is distributed into 45-47 sessions meant to be read one at a time. It is a must-read book and should be completed within two months of starting your preparation.\nTest Series\nThis is like the Holy Grail of CAT preparation. Subscribe to one good Test Series and write all the tests very sincerely in simulated environment. Fix a day, say Sunday, fix a time, say 9 AM, and give the test every week at the same time. Sit in proper position while attempting the test and tell all your roommates or family members not to disturb you at that time.\nOnce you write 15-20 such tests, CAT will no longer be a stranger to you. When you will sit for actual CAT, you will feel as if you have done this a lot of times and it will help you to remain confident during the exam. You can buy Catking Mock Series consist of Basic and Advance level CAT questions.\nTo improve in the Verbal section your need to have a grasp on the following:\n1. Reading and comprehending ability: Comprehension is more important than speed of reading\n2. Reasoning Skills: Improve your critical reasoning skills. This will not only help your solve the verbal reasoning questions but also the Reading Comprehensions questions\n3. Grammar and usage\nReading is important but your ability to Summarize correctly after you read an article/passage is also very vital. Work on this ability and I am sure you will be able to improve your CAT scores in this section.(Remember understanding a passage correctly is more important than reading it faster). Catking has come up with an excellent Verbal Maximizer Course which consist of 500 questions covering entire verbal syllabus with recorded solutions along with 50 Test sets.\nAbility in Maths is one of the most important in management entrance tests. If one considers Data Interpretation as part of maths, then the quantitative portion is 2/3rd of the paper. People who are weak in maths need not fear since a logical approach will help clear this section quite easily. Topics like number systems, percentages, profit and loss, time and distance, must be thoroughly done. A large part of the paper has algebra too, so the student must have complete knowledge of quadratic equations, functions, logs and the like.\nQuestions on geometry and co-ordinate geometry are also asked. Hence a strategic approach towards such topics is necessary which can be taught only by the one who is experienced. Faculty at Catking are not only experienced but also Toppers of their field. For further details visit our website www.catking.com. You can also watch our Quant Shortcut videos at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=....\nHope it helps:)', 'This the same answer I gave to a different question. But well, the questions are similar as well.\nLet me burst some myths first if possible.\nReading newspapers in NOT sufficient or necessary for Verbal Ability preparation. I got through without reading newspaper, though I had to read it in preparation for interviews.\nTheoretical books DON’T help you clear Quant or LRDI. All you need from the books is practice.\nThe so-called shortcuts do not help everyone. For example, I never do multiplication using the ‘vedic multiplication techniques’. But, put me in a contest with anyone who does that and I will always win. Only because I practiced a lot and the usual method works for me better.\nThere is no set method to solve any kind of question. If there was, everyone would be able to answer that question. The ones who prepare the exam want people who can think. Not people who prepare.\nSelf-preparation? I am sorry to say this, but it doesn’t work like that. Very few, probably 20–30 out of 2 lakh can do that. No one is that good. You need to get inputs from others regularly. There are a lot of things that you wouldn’t know if you study on your own.\nCAT is not enough! Don’t make it your sole aim to get through CAT. Interviews which come after CAT are equally, if not more, important.\nNow, Let’s see a general outline to improve yourself till the exam.\nStart writing Mocks immediately. I consider them the most important part of preparation. I took so many mocks that I felt the CAT exam as another mock. That removed a lot of pressure.\nMocks give you an idea where you stand. Take it up from there. Analysis each mock you write for probably half an hour. You would know your strong and weak areas from 3–4 mocks.\nFor verbal, reading is very important. But, rather than reading, the way you read it more important. Newspaper doesn’t help much because the style of writing is factual. There are different styles of writing and you need to be aware of all. So, read different books. There are going to be around 6 passages. These will from the domains of philosophical, historical, scientific, fictitious and reporting. Most important -’You cannot spend more than 5 minutes on any passage.’ Basically, you have to glance through the passage after reading the first paragraph in detail. You need to spend atleast 2 minutes on each question in the passage. Don’t just answer. Read the question thoroughly. I got 95 percentile in Verbal in 2015. 99.91 in 2016. Why? This was the change I adopted.\nPractice a lot for Quant and DILR. But, don’t ever just practice. If it was that easy, every who can do hard-work will get through. Develop your thinking abilities. Try to devise atleast 2 ways of solving every single problem. Especially for quant, try to look at the way in which you can solve the problem without using pen, paper or calculator. To develop your calculating abilities, whenever you are free to do this - Take two 3-digit numbers at random and try to multiply them in your mind. Then, check it by hand. This will help you in DILR. Look at which method works for you the best.\nLast but not the least, let me recommend two things for you-\nTry as much as possible to limit your rough work. You are not guaranteed to get more than two rough sheets in the exam. I recommend using 2 sides for DILR, 1 and half side for Quant and half if required for verbal.\nI recommend not using calculator for quants. I assure you from the experience of atleast 50 mocks from TIME and 2 actual CAT exams that using the onscreen calculator for quants just wastes time.\nHope I was helpful.\nYou can also follow my Blog for regular updates on preparation.\ncat2017prep.blogspot.in', ""‘The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex, overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, then starting on the first one.’ - Mark Twain\nCAT Preparation may take 10–12 months for a person with average past academic record, 6–8 months for a person with above average past academic record and 3–4 months for a person with excellent past academic record. As CAT’17 is held in end of November/December, December’16 or January’17 is the best time to start your preparation.\nDivide the preparation in phases. The reason to divide the preparation in phases is that you need to have clear goals for every month/phase.\nPhase 1: Till December\nDevelop reading Skills\nDevelop your reading skills by reading daily newspaper editorials and business news so that you can simultaneously improve your reading speed and knowledge which shall help you during your GD-PI process. Don’t just read newspaper articles, try to understand it and if possible, try getting greater insights of the topic by doing self-research on the internet. This will surely improve your analysing skills, vocabulary and knowledge. This process of developing reading skills should continue not only till your GD-PI but for lifetime.\nGet clear idea about various MBA entrance Exams and B-schools\nPGDM or MBA is not just about CAT and IIM. There are many other institutes which match the levels of IIM i.e. MDI, XLRI, SPJIMR, etc.\nMany of the top institutes like NMIMS, SIBM, XLRI conduct their own entrance tests. Go through their batch profile, placement figures, Job offered profile and then decide whether you really want to do PGDM or MBA. It is been observed that many join B-schools only considering the lucrative packages.\nPhase 2: January to April\nSyllabus for Quant:\nSyllabus for DI :\nSyllabus for LR:\nSyllabus for Verbal:\nFirstly you need to analyse your aptitude level. Take a Free Mock Test available online. Though it is a tiring process, you will be able to get clear idea about the exam pattern, level of difficulty. It also depends on your understanding of school – level Maths and Verbal concepts.\nIf you scored low (<60%) in these topics in school and it reflects in your Free Mock also, then you would be requiring assistance in your preparation.\nIf you scored average (60%-80%) in these topics in school and had average score in Free Mock, then you can prepare by self by subscribing to various course material provided online and with Mock tests.\nIf you scored more than 80% in these topics in your school and had average score in Free Mock, you are clear on your concepts and you require practice of various types of questions and Mock Tests. If any point of time, you feel you are not confident about your school concepts, I recommend you take assistant from experts for preparation.\nOnce you have figured out your requirements, now start your practice. Considering that you might be working professional or a college student, devote 1-2 hours daily depending upon the other prior commitments. Dedicate the months of January to April to understand the concepts and practising the easy to medium level questions.\nMake a strict study plan for each day. Also keep weekly dose of entertainment, parties in mind while preparing your schedule. Considering these stuffs makes your plan more realistic and practical to follow. Divide the CAT syllabus into small sections.\nTrack your preparation. Analyse what you practice with data points like Questions solved in the week, Average accuracy of a topic, your strengths and weakness, important formulae and tricks for easy calculation. Log in to India's most fun, adaptive and personalized online preparation platform for MBA entrance tests like CAT, XAT, SNAP, NMAT, IIFT, etc. to start your preparation because it is based on adaptive algorithm, it gives analysis of your practice questions, you can create your customised study plan and track your compliance.\nPhase 3: April to November\nBy mid of April, you should be well versed with the concepts and what you require now is practice. Take sectional tests. Know your strengths and weakness. Work on your weakness because at this time, you will start developing the comfort level with particular sections or topics.\nSimulating the test environment is an important aspect. Start taking mock tests. Analyse your mocks as it will give you clear idea of your strengths and weakness, strategy to attempt a mock, time management. How to analyse Mock Tests?\nYou should try out multiple strategies for improvement and see what works best for you. The best suited strategy should be applied to last 5–6 mocks which will eventually give you confidence to go forward with your strategy in actual CAT.\nTry to take at least 15 mocks. Don’t give multiple mocks in a day as your brain needs rest and you need time to anaylse your test and work on your weakness and strengths.\nPhase 4: A week before CAT 2017\nDon’t try to solve any new topic or take Mock tests. Suggested thing to do is to revise the formulae and the mocks which you have given. Go through the bookmarked questions.\nDon’t solve or revise any questions just a day before. Relax your body and brain. Don’t over sleep or do strenuous work. Nothing can be improved in a day, so avoid doing anything that affects you in negative way. Don’t get drunk or don’t overeat a day before.\nGet up fresh on D-Day and calm yourself as a steady mind always gives better result than a mind with fears. Give your best in CAT. Go and have a party with your friends (you deserve one!) for enduring the 12 months of preparation for the one of the toughest exam in India."", 'We can safely assume that a preparation period of more than 8-10 months is sufficient to crack CAT. However, that does not mean one should wait till then.\n \n If you have more time at your disposal, it would be better to start preparing right away.\n \n So, let\'s take it on a phase-by-phase basis.\nPhase I.\n \n Utilize time to chalk out a preparation strategy for maximum efficiency and to improve your vocabulary and general awareness (both of which cannot be done as part of a crash course)\n1. Analyze your strengths and weaknesses\n Do numbers scare you? Has probability always been a foe? Are the RC passages long and boring and put you to sleep? What about your reading speed? Is it 100 wpm or 200? Is it enough? Do words like factitious and proclivity confuse you?\n Then start to work on them.\n2. Start reading\n The best way to build a vocabulary and a critical mindset which will come handy while attempting the Verbal and RC section of the examination is by reading. Read anything - books, novels, newspapers, magazines, blog posts, other online articles etc.\n This will also help you to increase your reading speed (anything below 300 wpm will be a deterrent) and also to focus in case the topics in the examination are dry (for example, History, Politics etc)\n \n Set a reading target. Also, have a target list ready.\n A good place to begin will be the BBC list of Top 100 Books.\n A book a week would enable you to finish all 100 in less than 2 years.\n3. Start working on your problem solving abilities\n Start reading through brain-teasers. Solve logical problems. Start exercising your brain cells to boost your IQ.\n This exercise will be useful not only for the examination but also for your life in general.\n4. Extra focus on vocabulary\n Building a good vocabulary is a tedious exercise; one that requires a tremendous amount of patience and persistence. Thankfully, there are many tools and hacks to help you with it - word maps, flash cards etc. These visual aids always help.\nPhase II.\n Now would be a good time to join a coaching class and start working with a schedule and deadlines ready.\n \n Many people ask if coaching is mandatory and if you can crack the exam without it. The answer is NO; it is definitely not mandatory, however, it would be helpful because of the following reasons:\n \nDiscipline: Procrastination is something everyone encounters in case of assignments with long deadlines. The same is the case here. Unless you commit to a classroom schedule, people generally tend to put it off for future. Having classes and having paid for all of them in advance ensures that you attend them, at the very least, listen to the instructor and soak in the very basic concepts.\nCompetition and bench-marking: The classes give you a glimpse of the competition you are going to face moving forward. You would find people who come prepared for every class, listen intently to everything being said and take down meticulous notes. The same motivates you to also start working your ass off.\nFaculty: These guys who are going to teach you have years of experience. They are fairly familiar with the exam pattern, the types of questions that are asked and tricks to solve them in the shortest time possible.\nEnsure that you attend all classes and are at par with everyone else. Take out time to revisit the concepts once after the class. Trust me, it makes a lot of difference to how much of the same is retained by you.\n \n Phase III:\n This is the most important phase. Time to finally put everything you have learnt to test. Every coaching center has their own test series where you can give any no. of mock tests and you are given a percentile score to benchmark you against your peers.\n \n A few pointers:\n· Aim to complete 2 mock tests per week i.e. 16 - 20 in 2 months. This will give you ample time to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses and to fine tune your strategy\n· Every mock test result should be analyzed and monitored to ensure that you are making clear progress with every subsequent attempt\n· Apart from mock tests, there are sectional tests. If after, say 5 tests, you realize that you are weak in one particular area, head over to that section and practice away. Sectional tests are around 10-20 questions for about 30 minutes each.\nPhase IV : A few (10-12) days before the exam\n \n You should ideally relax for a week before the exam.\n1. Just read a couple of daily newspapers and avoid reading anything else so as not to cluster your mind with unnecessary information.\n2. Preferably pick up a book you have already read and one that you immensely adore. Re-read it.\n3. Listen to music.\n4. Talk to friends.\n5. Go to a good movie.\n6. Avoid the temptation to attempt ""one last"" mock test. At any cost. (If, by ill fate or due to nervousness, the outcome is not good, it might deeply hamper your performance in the actual exam)\n7. Do anything you like - if you are a painter, paint; if you are a guitarist, practice; but the most important part, take a good power nap. It will help you to relax, and will make you more productive.\nCheers!']"

I would like to share the same here. I hope it will ans the your question very aptly.\nA letter to CAT 2016 Aspirants\nDear CAT 16 aspirants!\nI am sure each one of you is having a tough time, struggling for working on CAT 16 strategies or keeping a check on your peer’s mock scores which would again be upsetting you more. Not to forget the IIM Bangalore releasing the CAT notification, would be like a turning point in your chilled out life or say, an icing on the cake.( sarcasm :P)\n“ The best view comes after the hardest climb”\nI hope this does better to appease your — yet so obvious but so complicated relationship with CAT 16! No worries for I understand each pain point in this journey and would be more than happy to let you take me back in time.\nSo, the target is all set and so is the bait! Tighten your seat belts to experience the most thrilling journey of your life — THE CAT’16\n15 months-12 months-9 months-5 months-3 months- 1 month-“ Kill me please day”\nGuess what? This is how we have been delaying our CAT preparation to read about letters like these wherein we are assured to Crack CAT in a month or two. Believe it or not I wasted 9 months relying on such assurances, when one night a 22.1 %ile from a mock CAT hit my senses hard and woke me up from my much prolonged CAT fantasies. This fake 22.1% did change to real 94.8 but to note- everything changed since then. This is what happened\nThe transition phase:-\n1) Read, Read and Read is what I was told would help me, and I must say- It saved me.\n2) 1–2 hours of study on weekdays and 5 hrs of serious study over weekends.\n3) A daily dosage of Sudoku, The Hindu’s editorial page and Testfunda’s wordlist.\n4) VA ate my mind with a daily practise of atleast 50 questions\n5) Quantum CAT by Sarvesh K verma, a friend who walks me through all such possible questions that could trouble me in the CAT exam\n6) Frequent beer breaks to keep me alive :P\n7) TIME AIMCAT series to help you get a feel of CAT.\n8) Weekly 3 mock CATs\n9) Strength & Weakness analysis for my mock CATs (Weakness in my case :P). I used the analysis to devise a useful strategy- 60% time on strength and 40% on weakness.\n10) Admito (www.admito.in) - for choosing the perfect college. A must for every MBA aspirant.. Oh yes! They helped save much on what others knowingly spend on — college application& shortlisting.\nAnd lastly, I practiced well to calm myself down during such stressful situations upon which I feel CAT was nearing and so was my end. I believed in CAT as an extension to my experiences in the journey of life and dealt with it with a positive approach.\nCAT might have occupied 90% of your time as of now but after some time it would be MBA Admissions and lately dealing with your stressful schedule in MBA colleges. Believe me it is your efforts and positive approach that make you climb the highest ladder of success.

For CAT strategy, two things are necessary: one is you focus on smart concepts, those that you can possibly apply in the exam time to save a few seconds; and the second is proper mock-examination ethic. To expand on the first, there are many possible ways to solve a question and some tricks might be necessary to build a good base of knowledge. Here, I will like to touch upon another topic, ‘Is coaching necessary to crack CAT?’ . I will like to answer this in a very realistic way, it is a post graduation examination and most of you would be busy with jobs and college studies. To cover all necessary tricks across these 10–11 months is nearly impossible if you go about studying from books only. Unless you have really good basics and supporting work-ethic, I will advice you to garner support in the form of a coaching. But, which coaching? This is a really important question. I took support from an online coaching, Elites Grid after extensive research on both online and offline coaching. It is a Delhi-based coaching and you can join the offline batch as well if you live in the vicinity. I will suggest you to look into it for some reasons as cited below:\n1: The faculty is exceptional: Hemant Malhotra, Shahzar Khan and Gaurav Kapoor are phenomenal mentors. Hemant Malhotra would take up Quants and LR-DI and Shahzar Khan VA-RC. Gaurav Kapoor will make you practice over questions from all three sections. The personal support throughout the preparation and doubt-solving with lengthy explanations slowly builds a great mindset for the final three hours.\n2: Question-base is exceptional: I have covered questions from TIME, IMS, Bullseye, TestFunda, Cracku etc. Though the TIME and IMS material is something I would still recommend, but they issue their basic packages in early season and though the packages are replete with questions, but the standard of these basic packages are not at par with CAT. There final packages for CAT and other exams are really good, but you get them in May-June, which is a bit late. Here, from the Day 1 you are exposed to questions ranging from Greenhorn to Brutal level, so you have an ample amount of time to build the right mind-set.\n3: Doubt-solving: This is one of the major parts of preparation for any competitive examination but is grossly underestimated. You might face a plethora of doubts through your preparation, and you would need someone to solve them with efficient methods. In offline coaching, you will have to wait up for a class, and by then you might lose out on the flow, but here, you can shoot up your query and both the mentor and the entire batch of students stand at your beck and call. Also, you get more than one approach to solve out the problem, which is absolutely perfect.\n4: Value of time: You will be preparing throughout an year and it matters what you gain out of this time. Though a 100 percentile seems enough of a reward right now for your hard-work, but trust me, you can get way more here. The mentors are both counsellors and they help you on conundrums bigger than a CAT score. This matters much more on retrospection.\nNow, coming to the second part the ‘proper mock-examination ethic’, this is another under-rated portion for the examination. CAT is much more about time-management and introspection on your skill-set than knowledge. Knowledge only gets you half-way through the path. You will need to work on your actual examination ethic and understand how you behave in the examination. Do you miss question that were easy? Do you spend more time on a harder set where you could have fetched double marks through easier ones? Should I read the passage or skim? Should I go with my gut? It is a never-ending list. The following points might help you to achieve the most of the mocks:\n1:Knowledge about your skill-set: What are you good at? Arithmetic or Geometry? RC or Para-jumbles? And so on and so forth. It helps a lot to know your strengths and weaknesses. Work correspondingly to get better results.\n2: Your attitude: This is one thing that is actually very important. Do I stick to questions and lose time? Am I biased in my approach to topics? Example, I used to find sets from Games and Tournaments very hard, so I used to never attempt them in first-go until one day I realised that I was attempting harder sets due to my bias on the topic.\n3: Proper paper-ethic and analysis: These mocks are not just to be done and left-out, they are to be analysed at length, the marks are not to be compared with peers but with yourself. There are three columns except the sectional and total scores and percentiles. First, “Comments”- Here you will jot down the overall analysis summary-like it was a brutal DI-LR but I did satisfactory. Made 1 silly mistake…..and so on. Second, “Sectional scope”- this would be how much could you have scored on a section more, REALISTICALLY. As in you wasted about 6 mins in a question and could not see the last three questions out of which two were easy. So your scope is +3 only, coz you did one correct, but you could have done two. Third is “Immediate Need”, here you will list out the major flaw. When you keep jotting this down, you get huge insights to work through your flaws.\nFocus on sectionals as well, for that go for sectional mocks. A combination of TIME and IMS mock-tests are recommended. Take an aim of 50 full length mocks and 30 sectional mocks for each section at least throughout the preparation. You can also try BullsEye for the start until IMS starts it mock-series.\nThe above strategy with mentors from Elites Grid helped me immensely to succeed.\nWebsite for Elites Grid: Elite Grid Academy\nCAT 2018 Strategy (Elites Grid) -https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=h...\nELITES GRID LINK OF CAT 2018 COURSE- Log into Facebook | Facebook\nYou might need to access the group for that place a request to join.\nLink for some recommended books, would be adding more soon\nBooks - Google Drive\nHope this helps, and ALL THE BEST.']"

"How should I start preparing for CAT 16 all over from scratch without joining any institute beginning in July? Can anyone suggest a study plan, books and materials, mock test and preparation guides?",19 Answers,"['CAT Preparation 2016\nCAT (Common Admission Test) 2016\nMBA Students\nMBA Preparation\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I start preparing for CAT 16 all over from scratch without joining any institute beginning in July? Can anyone suggest a study plan, books and materials, mock test and preparation guides?']","[""There are a lot of students who study for more than 1 year for CAT, and then there are also those who crack the exam by preparing for 3 months. I have come across quite a few examples of students who have studied for just 3 months and managed to crack the exam and make it to some of the top IIMs. But the time that has to be given per day could be atleast 4 hours on a regular basis. Here I am going to discuss a plan to prepare for CAT with 4 months to go i.e. if you start preparing from mid July, how do you go about it.\nI would broadly breakup the preparation into three parts. First the syllabus, second mocks and analysis and third mocks and revision.\nTime frame for each is as follows:\nSyllabus – 1.5 months\nMocks + Analysis – 2 months\nMocks + Revision – 0.5 month\nFirst Stage – Syllabus:\nQuants: When you are trying to complete the syllabus, spend around 1 to 2 days on a topic. Avoid spending more than that. If you spend more time here you will get less time for the second stage which important for cracking the exam. Solving around 15 to 30 sums per topic would suffice. Solve less sums on the topic you are comfortable with and more sums on the topic you find difficult. Spend around 3 days in these 45 days solving mocks – once every 15 days - to see if you are going in right direction and to know your strengths and weaknesses. Rest of the 42 days spend time on your preparation. Spending around 1.5 to 3 hours a day on Quants (1.5 hours if it is a strong area and 3 or more hours if it is a weak area) should suffice.\nVerbal: It is important that you spend enough time on reading as part of your verbal preparation as CAT mainly tests you on comprehension of passages. In CAT15 there were 24 RC questions from the total 34 Verbal questions. Need not do vocab, unless you are from vernacular medium or really find the need for it. CAT does not focus too much on Vocabulary. Apart from that you can do a little grammar. Don’t get into too much of grammar as it could be quite confusing. If you come across something important or commit some mistakes in the questions, write it in a book and go through it regularly. You can create schedule as follows:\nApart from the above solve 1 or 2 RC passages and spend considerable time on reading everyday.\nRoughly 1 to 1.5 hours on the topic of study, 0.5 hrs on RC passages and 1 to 1.5 hrs on reading.\nDI and LR: A good way to practice is to solve 1 question of each DI and LR everyday. Can focus on the following topics on DI/LR.\nMaximum 1 hour on DI and LR combined per day should suffice.\nWhat I have given above is the rough sketch with regards to preparation for the basics. Dont get disheartened if you fall behind schedule. Do as much as possible everyday without saturating yourself.\nThere are others who are working and cannot give enough time. For them they need to proportionately reduce the time spent on each area, but ensure that you give maximum time to your weak area.\nSo assuming you will cover it in 1.5 months, you still will have 2.5 months to go for the exam.\nFor the next two stages, can refer to the following link: Patrick Dsouza's answer to I have finished with my basics, how do I plan my remaining time with 2.5 months left for CAT?\nIf you want to join Facebook group for CAT preparation -https://www.facebook.com/groups/cat100percentile/\nFor free WhatsApp group for CAT Preparation, WhatsApp to 9821314788.\nWebsite: www.patrickcat100percentile.com"", 'CAT 2016 is expected to be held in November 2016 which gives you around 5 months to prepare. As you don’t want to join an institute for preparation, I suggest you explore some online preparation options.\nPreparation for CAT involves 4 stages:\nGetting well versed with every basic concepts of the syllabus\nDedicate the month of July and mid-August to understand the concepts and practising the easy to medium level questions. You should make a strict study plan for each day. Also keep the other stuffs like weekly dose of entertainment, parties in mind while preparing your schedule. Accounting these stuffs makes your plan more realistic and practical to follow. Divide the CAT syllabus into small sections and try to complete each section within a week. Track your preparation. Get a excel sheet made where you analyse what you practice with data points like Questions solved in the week, Average accuracy of a topic, your strengths and weakness, important formulae and tricks for easy calculation. I would suggest that you can get started with online material of PRAQTISE because they have an adaptive algorithm and it gives analysis of what you practice and they have study plan feature. So the website will track your weekly preparation and no need to do extra effort for tracking your progress. You can try out books of TIME and CL. They have good quality questions. Bookmark the questions which you think is important.\n2. Strike while the iron is hot\nBy mid of August, you should be well versed with the concepts and what you require now is practice till August end. Mould yourself to difficult questions. Try to solve sectional tests. Know your strengths and weakness. Work on your weakness as this is the time when you will start developing the comfort level with particular sections or topics.\n3. Take MOCKS\nSimulating the test environment is an important aspect. Start giving mock tests. Mocks of TIME are on difficult side (more difficult than actual CAT themselves), IMS and CL mocks are CAT level mocks. Analyse your mocks till death as it will give you clear idea of your strengths and weakness, strategy to attempt a mock, time management. You should try out multiple strategies for improvement and see what works best in your favour. Every person adopts a different strategy. There is no strategy which guarantees success. The best suited strategy should be applied to last 5–6 mocks which will eventually give you confidence to go forward with your strategy in actual CAT. Always have a plan B if plan A fails. Try to take at least 15 mocks. Don’t give multiple mocks in a day as your brain needs rest and you need time to anaylse your test and work on weakness and strengths.\n4. A week before CAT 2016\nIt is advisable to not to solve any mocks in the penultimate week as the performance in the mocks will affect your mindset and you won’t be able to give your 100% during CAT due to fear of those mock results. Don’t try to solve any new topic. Suggested thing to do is to revise the formulae and the mocks which you have given. Go through the bookmarked questions.\nDon’t solve or revise any questions just a day before. I know it feels weird but trust me you will do no good in a day, so avoid doing anything bad. Just as the saying goes ’ Rome was not built in a day’ . Chill around with your friends but please don’t get drunk or don’t overeat a day before.\nGet up fresh on D-Day and calm yourself as a steady mind always gives better result than a mind with fears. Give your 100% in CAT. Come home, no discussion on CAT. Give yourself a treat (you deserve one!) for enduring the 5 months of preparation for the one of the toughest exam in India.', 'The time after engineering is the best to prepare for CAT, because you are far away from the job responsibilities and all set to make your career through CAT without any second thought. Devoting the upcoming four months for preparation entirely will surely lead you in cracking CAT.\nStudy Plan:\nYou can choose Arun Sharma’s books respective to the CATs different sections. Refer to online course “Handa Ka Funda” for structuring your CAT preparation. It will help you in the self-preparation a lot. The live doubt clarification classes will help you in clarifying your doubts as you are starting from the scratch. Listed below is a detailed plan for starting from the basics and then slowly stepping to advance level of the CAT preparation.\nJULY:\nEditorials - I suggest you to start your English preparation with a determination to read editorials every day. Read two editorials from a newspaper like The Hindu, Mint, The Economic Times, etc.\nNovels - Start reading a fiction novel of authors like Khaled Hosseni, Jeffrey Archer, etc. Later start reading non-fiction novels.\nMake notes of the new words you have come across and its meaning. You can do the respective using app Evernote, which would help you later going through it anywhere & anytime.\nStrengthen your basic grammar and practice sentence completion through the video tutorials. Kaplan’s GMAT book for “Sentence Correction & Reading Comprehension” will hone your skills in RC section.\nAUGUST – You are ready to practice advanced CAT level questions.\nSEPTEMBER:\nOCTOBER:\nMake notes post the test for the reasons leaving a question unanswered or answering it wrong. This will prevent you from making repetitive mistakes. Opt for TIME’s mock test series as they have a larger audience enrolled in their mocks which will help you to gauge your performance with respect to serious aspirants.\nNOVEMBER:\n“All you just need now is Rehearsal”\n“Practicing helps in learning and analyzing rehearsals helps polishing your practice for the final performance.”\nSo take mock tests twice a week, do-good revisions of the notes you have made until now. The mock tests for “Handa Ka Funda” available after the notifications of CAT is released are of CAT level and I recommend to take them to analyze your strengths and weaknesses.\nRelax a week before the final test, don’t take too much stress just go through basics and notes.\nKeep Calm & Believe in Yourself. Strive for the best.\nThanks for A2A. Hope I helped I you.\nGood Luck!', 'If you are preparing without any coaching then I would recommend you the following way to do so,\n1.Grammar: For this there is no shortcut, you can learn techniques to make your learning process easier but no certain shortcut to your immediate goal. The book I would refer you for grammar is Wren and Martin, ETS guide for GMAT and some sample test papers. Now do these books as given in order and you will be thorough with your grammar command in about 3–4 months. Learn grammar from the bottom of your heart and most of the topic that you will come across are already covered in your school life and might not need much attention.\n2. Vocabulary : Now, vocab is not the most concentrated portion of your paper but an average Indian candidate does not necessarily have a wide range of words under his or her belt so it is good to devote as much time possible. learning and mugging up words are 2 different things and need to addressed differently, so please try to understand the context the word is being presented in rather than focusing solely on meaning. Pickup the material for reading that lies in your comfort zone and mark the words that you find new, later find the roots and antonym and synonym for the same and this is the process you need to follow. The books that I would refer to you for this very reason are; Word power made easy and the ETS guide for GRE . It is not necessary that you will have to devote same amount of time on this section, if you have less time left for this reason and want to brush up on some vocab then I would recommend you to download an app called VoLT ( Vocabulary learning Technique) this is something that I stumbled upon while my prep for CAT and I personally found it very useful as it has pictorial presentation of words, roots and what not. Accessible anywhere and everywhere is just a perky bonus as well.\n3.Logical Reasoning; Now this section as suggested by name is dependent on ones logical aptitude and I would recommend to buy a correspondence pack of some coaching institution that you find reputed enough. Just like quant and grammar, there are no shortcuts for success in this section and one needs to keep on practicing until mastered.\nAs far as the quant and DI section is concerned you can start preparing in the following pattern, (Assuming that you have a decent enough basic knowledge of Maths till 10th)\n1.Practice material of some coaching institution that you find reputed enough, as they make these material as per latest pattern and are really helpful to determine the difficulty and what not.\n2.Solve past year papers\n3.Quantitative Aptitude for the CAT Common Admission Test by Arun Sharma for simple and easily understanding purpose\n4.Quantitative Aptitude Quantum CAT Common Admission Test for Admission into IIMs by Sarvesh K. Verma\nNow please dont make a schedule where you find youself studying for 4–5 hours non stop daily or even 2 days a week, scatter your preparation for a longer duration but please make the duration of studying per day a little close to 2–3 hours.\nAIMCATS from TIME is good as well.']"
How can I prepare for the CAT 2019?,13 Answers,['CAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow can I prepare for the CAT 2019?'],"['Well, it is a very commonly asked question by most aspirants. Before answering this question I would like to applaud you. Since, you have planned to write CAT in 2019 and start thinking and making plans right from now to crack it. Though 7-8 is an ideal time to prepare for CAT. But you have about 28 months from now, you can do it very very efficiently. You can be at the par level of some of the best CAT trainers in India. Yes no mocking, seriously you can be at par!\nConsidering the fact that IIM can’t change the sections at which they test the students, you have to prepare for four sections. Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation (DI), Logical Reasoning (LR), Quantitative Aptitude (QA).\nSince you have 28 months of time from now, you can explore and learn plenty of it. Starting from VARC section, start learning 4 words from today daily upto 25 months. Yes you don’t need to learn more than 4 words. They are enough for the day. So total words you can learn in 25 months period is 25*30*4=3000 words!!! Taking the assumption of 30 days a month. Phew!!! They are more than enough to decode the tough RC’s, whatever level of it could be. Do 1 reading (article or editorial from newspaper, I would suggest to read The Hindu) a day. You will complete about 750 readings and these will cover various topics like Philosophy, History, Finance, Politics, Psychology, Science and Technology, History, Current affairs, International News, etc. This will help you to understand the main idea of the passage and you will also learn about the various writing styles of authors. This will act as the main factor in decoding RC’s. Also, apart from readings solve 1 RC a day. And the rest remains Verbal Ability. Paragraph Jumbles, Summary of the passage, Critical Reasoning, Odd sentence out, Fill in the blanks, Last line of the paragraph, Facts Inference and Judgement, Paragraph Completion etc are some frequent topics that are tested in recent years. You can solve plenty of questions and will have enough grip on them. This is all about the VARC section.\n2) DI-LR\nNow coming to DI-LR part, which is the toughest section in the paper and the test takers give up while solving the sets. The best way is to crack this section is to start practicing solve from level 1 or even level 0 questions. Make up your speed and solve with 100% accuracy. Caution: Don’t look at the previous CAT question in the start of your preparation if you are not good at it initially. Seriously you lose hope and give up and keep this in mind that scoring 50% of marks in this section will surely fetch you 99+ percentile or even 99.5+ Because questions are lengthy and bit tough it it difficult for the students to solve the all the questions in the given time frame. That is the main reason why low scores will fetch you higher percentile.\n2a) DI\nSo in Data Interpretation mainly question on Tables, Column Graphs, Pie Charts, Bar Graphs, Frequency Graph, Line Charts, Venn Diagrams, Caselets and various combinations of these are asked. This section is calculation intensive and you have to work on mental calculation to increase your speed to give an edge over others. Learn Vedic Maths, Approximation techniques, Percentage calculation, Certain common fractions, Squares and Cubes of numbers to make your calculation faster. If you are slow in calculation then you will take up huge time to come at the final answer. So start focusing on calculations right from now and you will see that your speed will increase drastically. But you must have patience to arrive at the results.\n2b) LR\nIn Logical Reasoning, questions from Linear arrangements, Circular Arrangements, Arrangements based on Rankings, Games and Tournaments, Venn Diagrams, Cubes and Cuboids, Network Diagrams, Quantitative Reasoning mainly are asked. Other topics like Syllogism, Blood Relations, Binary Logic, Logic Connectives , Clocks and Calenders, Number and Alphabetic Series are also asked in other MBA exams but they are usually not asked in CAT. Though you should have a fair ideas of these topics too. You can solve 1 DI and 1 LR set a day and at later stage you can solve 2 sets from each topic in a day as well. They will be enough for you to come across at different models of the question.\n3) QA\nNow coming to the final section that is Quantitative Aptitude. If you will look at any book you will see that this section has a vast syllabus. But it is not true, This section test you in mathematical topics that you have studied in class 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th. No Calculus, 3D geometry, Conic sections, Trigonometry in it, which makes this section easier if you compare it with JEE level\nTopics from which the questions asked are Number Systems, Progressions, Algebra, Percentages, Profit and Loss, Time and Work, Ratio Proportion and Variations, Time and Work, Races, Inequalities, Logarithms, Quadratic Equations, Boats and Streams, Speed Time Distance, Mixtures and Alligations, Simple Interest and Compound Interest, Functions, Geometry and Mensuration, Permutations and Combinations, Probability and Set Theory. These are approximately 20 topics and you can definitely give an average of one month to each. Solve 10–15 questions a day, means you will be solving about 400 questions in a particular topic. That is a huge number and one can stop you in doing that. You will be the master if you are solving 400 questions from a particular topic. Divide 10 days each in solving question of Level 1,2,3 difficulty.\nAll the plans that I have discussed till now will not take more than 90 minutes a day (30 minutes for each section) and most importantly without the load of any time pressure beacause you have plenty of days from today. And 90 minutes a day to prepare for the national level exam like CAT is quite manageable and you can work out without finding any excuses. I am sure enough if you will work accordingly you will get 99.5+ percentile. No ifs and buts in it.\nNow the question arises from where to prepare from?\nI would suggest you to start doing preparation from you own side and skim through all topics. After a year you can join any coaching institute in India. Classroom Program will be the best. All coaching institutes are almostsame when it comes to study material, the only difference comes in the quality of trainers. If any coaching pays a high salary then you can assume that trainers will be well experienced. And fees of all coaching institutes is more or less the same. you will not find the difference of more than 5k.\nFirst of all, you purchase Arun Sharma Books. It will help you in building the base. I am mentioning the complete name of book and publication for your reference here.\nHow to Prepare for Quantitative Aptitude for the CAT by Arun Sharma, 7th edition, Mc Graw Hill Publications.\nHow to Prepare for Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension for CAT by Arun Sharma Meenakshi Upadhyay, 7th edition, Mc Graw Hill Publications\nHow to Prepare for Logical Reasoning for CAT by Arun Sharma, 4th edition, Mc Graw Hill Publications\nHow to Prepare for Data Interpretation for CAT by Arun Sharma, 4th edition, Mc Graw Hill Publications.\nI hope I have answered it clearly and all the best for your preparation!!\nCheers!!', ""Thank you for asking.\nAnswer might be bit long but it will be helpful for you. So use smartphone feature name scrolling and keep reading :p\nSo CAT 2019 is after 14 month and you still have enough amount of time to prepare for it.\nFirst CAT is divided into three parts namely Verbal ability, Logical reasoning and Quantitative aptitude.\nSo lets talk about how to prepare for CAT 19 each section wise.\n*Verbal Ability*\n1.Start reading newspaper not only with the point of reading or increasing your verbal marks but also with the aim of increasing your General knowledge power and current affairs. By reading news paper you are doing those two things together. But reading newspaper wont be sufficient as it does not contain any questions and you might understand something but there are chance you might miss out something that author wants to tell shile reading article. So apart from this,i would suggest you to solve RC..Solve RC not from books but from Online platform,as most of the exams are Online exams and there is huge difference when you give same exam with pen paper rather Online. So practice from online material. For that i would suggest you to join iquanta facebook group CAT Preparation - iQuanta where you will find atleast 5–6 RC daily posted by other aspirants and try to solve them. Apart from this there are website like rcprep or you can find RC100 pdf online. Start solving rc from there. As out of 34 questions,24 questions are of RC and 2–3 are of para summary which is also somewhere small RC. so i would suggest you to focus on RC the most.\nIf you are good with parajumbles then would suggest you to do it else just skip it like i always do.\n*DI*\nThis one is one of the stressful section for students fron last couple of years. Not only because it is tough but it also checks how quick your senses are and how you are in selecting the sets.\nThere will be couple of sets,which even they know that it is close to impossible for student to complete in the speed base exam like CAT and if you trap yourself in such sets,you might end up with disaster.\nSo the best thing to score in LR-DI is to practice more questions on daily basis so you understand which sets you shoukd leave and before attempting the sets what are the things you should look for.\nHere i would suggest you to join iquanta facebook groupCAT Preparation - iQuanta where you will find one event dedicated to LR-DI, where daily 3–4 sets are being posted with its solution. Try it on daily basis without time limit at this point and you will be good to go.\n*Quant*\nThis section is one of the most scoring section for student and you too should try to get maximum mark in this section.\nTry to clear you basics about each topic before attempting mocks or sectional. would recommend you to Join which is India's largest online prepartion group for CAT.

Ideally, a year is more than enough to crack this national level admission test. If you’re really passionate about pursuing a career in the field of management then you must be familiar with the rising competition level of this exam. Therefore, you must prepare for the exam whole-heatedly to crack it so that you can get admission in top management colleges in the country.\nPerformance in the exam is one of the main components for the selection of candidates in IIMs and other management institutes. IIMs also consider the academic performance and work experience of the candidates apart from the CAT score. Let’s go through the exam pattern of the CAT 2019 to get a brief insight into the structure of the whole exam-\nExam mode: Online (computer based test)\nDuration: 3 hours (1 hour for each section)\nTotal number of sections: There are a total of 3 sections in the CAT exam- Section-I: Verbal ability and reading comprehension, Section-II: Data interpretation and logical reasoning, Section-III: Quantitative ability.\nType of Questions: Objective type (MCQ based)\nMarking Scheme: 1 mark will be awarded for right answer\nNegative Marking: 0.33 marks will be deducted for wrong answer\nThe registration process for CAT 2019 will begin tentatively from the 2nd week of August 2019. Students should finish 80% of the syllabus by that time. Now let’s figure out the key to score good marks in the exam. Here are some useful preparation tips for CAT 2019 that will certainly help you fetching good marks in the admission test-\nDon’t neglect your graduation: If you’re in the final year of your graduation, then the first thing you need to keep in mind is to focus on maintaining good academic performance. College students most of time ignore this fact and dedicate all their energy in preparing for CAT which affect their overall performance of the graduation. Now this doesn’t mean that you don’t have to prepare for the CAT, you can prepare for the common admission test provided that you maintain good academic record.\nDon’t only focus on IIMs: It is commonly perceived notion that getting a good percentile in CAT will get you admission in top IIMs in the country which is partially true. You need to look beyond the IIM as there are other good B-schools that offer the same quality of education that the IIMs offer. Candidates focus solely on IIM and when they don’t get the result they’ve expected they go into depression. Therefore, prepare for the exam with a positive attitude that you have to give your best no matter what the cutoff will be. You must however prepare as per the level of IIM then only you can be sure of your performance.\nCAT is not only about the scores: There is a misconception among the candidates that scoring good marks in the CAT exam will set their life for good. The fact is that CAT score is just one of the many parameters used by the B-Schools to shortlist the candidates for interview process. You must not think about the scores while preparing for the exam otherwise this will impact your performance. Simply put your best foot forward and jump straight to the topics giving no regards to the scores whatsoever.\nThe key to success is practice: Practicing the mock test/test series on a regular basis is the only way to ensure success in the exam. A lot of students initially join a test series but as the time goes by they lose their study momentum and deviate from their schedule. This is the reason why some students clear the exam in their first attempt whereas some fail to clear even after giving multiple attempts.\nCurrent Affairs and joining the dots: To improve you English and reading comprehension, you must develop a habit of reading an English newspaper. Getting in touch with the current events affecting the world, business, and nation lets you form an opinion on the subject. This certainly helps you a lot in the interview. You should find the way to connect the dots leading to an event to get a clear picture. You may also watch English TV series/movies to improve your English Vocabulary.\nUse reliable books for CAT preparation: There are tons of CAT preparation books available in the market that can confuse the students. In such a case, students should only go for the books that give them the correct and reliable information. Here are some of the leading reference books which are famous among the aspirants for CAT preparation-\nVerbal ability and reading comprehension by Arun Sharma and Meenakshi Upadhaya\nWord power made easy by Norman Lewis\nHigh school grammar by Wren and Martin\nData interpretation by Arun Sharma\nLogical reasoning and DI for CAT by Pearson publications\nQuantitative aptitude for CAT by Arun Sharma\nStudy materials by TIME, Career Launcher, and IMS.\nShoot the depression: The preparation for CAT exam can be quite exhausting to some aspirants. But they don’t need to consider the exam as a situation of life and death. They should always bear in mind that it’s just another exam in life that you will take. The most important thing is that you learn from these experiences. So instead of losing hope you should stay positive and motivate yourself by reading the experiences of the previous year toppers who have faced the similar struggle when they were preparing for the CAT.\nStay positive and never lose hope!\nAll the Best!', 'If you have decided upon preparing for CAT 2019, then the first and the\nforemost thing is to understand the dynamics of this exam. It is a 3 hours\ncomputer based exam which is going to test your aptitude and language skills\nand eventually will decide your future as to which B school you will pursue\nyour MBA from. If you really aspire to go into an elite Business School, then\nmake up your mind that you need to score a very good percentile which is not a\ncakewalk. Slogging for hours will not do the job. There has to be meticulous\nplanning and optimization of resources. There are three sections in this exam-\nVerbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VaRC), Data Interpretation and\nLogical Reasoning (DILR) and Quantitative Aptitude (QA).All the three\nsections require a different skill set and their preparation requires a different\nstrategy.\nVARC checks upon the language skills of the candidate. The different modules\nin this section are grammar, reading comprehension, critical reasoning, para\njumbles and para completion and odd one out. But, if one considers the most\nscoring module, then reading comprehension holds the most prominent position.\nFrom the last few years there have been 24 questions (5 passages) out of 34\nquestions coming from this module. The best thing about it is that you don’t\nneed to have any prior knowledge. Simply one needs to understand the passages\nand solve the questions based upon your understanding of the passage. For\nsome, reading comes naturally as they have been reading novels and\nnewspapers since their childhood. So, they won’t face major problems in this\nmodule. But there are many who may struggle with comprehensions as they are\nnot in the habit of reading. So, the first step is to start reading a lot onscreen.\nRead novels, e-books, newspapers, articles to develop the habit of reading.\nMake a habit of reading The Hindu daily especially the editorial section. Also,\nstart practicing passages from GMAT club. It is an extensive store house of\ngood passages. All the passages are time based here, so it will help you in\nimproving your speed as well. Pick up good novels and when I am saying good\nit means novels of prominent authors where you can find enriched language. It\nwill help you to improve your grammar, to understand the structure of passages\nand more importantly will improve your stamina of reading.\nDILR- This is the most dreaded section of all the three. Every year the level of\ndifficulty has been constantly increasing and it has become a nightmare for\nmany. But this section requires a different strategy to ace. For Logical\nReasoning, you need to solve puzzles. Make a habit of solving sudoku on a\ndaily basis. Start solving two to three sets daily. Data Interpretation involves\ncalculations. So, squares of numbers, their cubes and conversion of percentages\ninto their equivalent fractions must be on your finger- tips. Pick up resources to\npractice and start solving them. Start from the basics and once you have gained\nsome confidence, then try to move to the difficult sets. Solve previous years’\nDILR sets. They are a brilliant resource to build your understanding and clarity\nof this section. Full length mock tests and the sectional tests will also give you a\nplethora of good quality sets.\nQA- This section is the most scoring of all the three and perhaps require most of\nyour energies and time to ace it. It has a proper syllabus and you need to\npractice each and every chapter. The major modules are- Geometry, Arithmetic,\nAlgebra, Number System and Modern Math. It is basically the math that you\nhave studied till tenth standard. But having said that, the questions are not really\neasy. For example when you studied geometry in your school, most of us would\nmug up the theorems and their proofs. But here one needs to apply these\ntheorems in solving a problem. So, getting an exposure to diverse models and a\nhell lot of practice will go a long way. Keep in mind that Arithmetic and\nAlgebra are the two most important modules. So, focus a lot on these two\nmodules. If mathematics scares you and your basics are shaky, then start with\nNCERT books to get a feel of the topics and gradually move to harder\nproblems.\nNow, there is one important aspect in the preparation. Whether to join a\nclassroom program or self-study will be enough. In my case I had joined\nclassroom program by Kitabee Education Services. I personally feel that\ncoaching helps you to trespass the restrictive boundaries set by our minds. A\ngood coaching guides you during the entire duration of your preparation,\nmotivates you to perform to your optimum and more importantly helps u in\ndesigning strategies other than the knowledge it imparts. It actually streamlines\nyour preparation. But, simply a coaching cannot guarantee you results. You\nhave to go the extra mile. You need to put in your best efforts to get the desired\npercentile. Also, join a good mock test series.\nI hope my answer helped u. All the best for your preparation.']"
Why should one prepare for CAT?,13 Answers,['CAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nWhy should one prepare for CAT?'],"['Going anonymous, since I don’t want my office colleagues know that I am preparing for CAT.\nThis is my CAT story. I gave CAT 2017 and scored 99.48%ile. Thanks to my General Engineering Male status didn’t get a call from ABCLI. Also , I could not convert my IIM-Kozhikode and FMS calls. Am I dejected? Hell yeah. Will I try again? Hell Yeah.\nI am giving CAT ’18 full aware that I need 99.98%ile at least, to get a call from IIM-A due to my low graduation scores. I know for the fact, that I might not get a call from IIM-B even after scoring 100%ile.\nAt this point I want to say that I work in a reputed product company with a handsome package and a very good work life balance.\nSo what drives me to work even hard to prepare for this exam. Plenty of reasons actually.\nAn MBA from an IIM opens up a whole new window of opportunities ranging from Strategy Consulting to Investment Banking to Marketing. This is a big break away for me from moving from 1 technology stack to another. An MBA thereby opens up a lot of industry verticals.\nThe 2 years of management education instills in an individual the rigour, versatility and persistence to survive in the management world. The most important take away we get from the top IIMs is time management. Loads of assignments with inflexible deadlines forces an individual to prioritize and manage time.\n2 years of corporate experience has made me aware of the importance of networking. Imagine being in a group of 400 top minds across the country, from different background and different experience level. This combined with the fact that the best management teachers would be teaching you. This makes striving to get into an IIM worthwhile.\nHow do I know all this. online student experiences and interaction with my friends who are in IIM has helped me understand the importance of the top IIMs.\nHope to make the cut in CAT 2018. :)\nAny suggestions are welcome\nEDIT: Thanks for your comments. Sorry, could not reply earlier.

Nothing stellar, but nothing really bad too.\nMoral of the story: The shortlisting and selection criteria isn\'t that straightforward.\nIt is common sense that someone would look at and evaluate the eligibility criteria for interviews before even preparing. It might so happen that some institute has some criteria that you already don\'t satisfy. All of the same are available on the institute websites.\nThis is precisely why I advise folks to not quit their jobs to prepare for CAT or have a backup career plan (for freshers).\nP.S. Below are the links for the eligibility and selection criteria for the 19 IIMs. They are updated every year for the next year\'s process. Any prospective CAT aspirant must ensure that they go through the eligibility criteria for that year, and satisfy at least some of them.\nThe first 7\nAdmission Details - IIMA\nIndian Institute of Management Bangalore\nAdmissions | IIMC\nEligibility : : IIML\nAnnouncement - IIMK\nAcademic Programmes - भारतीय प्रबंध संस्थान इंदौर - IIM Indore\nPost-Graduate Programme (PGP) Admissions at IIM Shillong\nThe next 6 (started on or after 2010)\nIIM Rohtak "" Admission\nIIM Ranchi - PGDM 2016 (Criteria)\nIIM Raipur\nIIM Trichy - PGPM Admission Criteria\nIIM Udaipur - Post Graduate Programme | Programs | Home\nIIM Kashipur\nThe final 6 (started in 2015)\nIIM NAGPUR\nIIM Bodhgaya\nIIM-Visakhapatnam\nIIM Amritsar\nIIM Sirmaur\nIIM Sambalpur - भारतीय प्रबंध संस्थान इंदौर - IIM Indore', 'CAT is an exam for the admissions to the MBA colleges in India, it is the father of all MBA exams in india and the majority of the colleges accepts the score of CAT for the latter part of the selection process. The preparation varies from candidate to candidate, if you are in the final year of your exam you need to prepare for the exam simultaneously with the college studies. If you are a working professional then you need to manage the preparation with your work commitments.\nBut, some of the things which has been generalised for everyone is that you have to clear the basics in the three sections of CAT as per the latest pattern. You should plan a schedule in such a way that you cover all the areas in a week as each section is equally important.\nThe three sections which comprises the syllabus of CAT are:\nA. Reading Comprehension and Verbal Ability\n B. Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation\nC. Quantitative Ability\nI would say you invest 2–3 days for Quantitative Ability, 1 day for Logical Reasoning, 1 day for Data interpretation and remaining for the language section.\nYou can also join a classroom or online programs for CAT preparation if you want to have a more elaborate preparation and you need guidance during your preparation expedition.\nOnce you are done with 60–70% of the course, I will suggest you that you should start taking Mocks which will help you analyse your weak and strong areas which you can later work out to improve in these areas.\nYou can have a look at the online course for CAT preparation here Online CAT Coaching Course for CAT 2017 Exam Preparation.', ""Before we start talking abut the %iles, preparation strategies & all the stuff, let's start by the paper itself!\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nComputer Based Test\nTime: 180mins (60mins each for all 3 sections)\nQuestions: 100(VA-34; LRDI-32; QA-34)\nSections: Verbal & Reading Comprehension (VRC); Logical Reasoning & Data Interpretation (LRDI); Quantitative Ability (QA)\nAll specific details as per CAT 2015 & are subject to change in future!\n## In general exam is conducted in the last week of November, on yearly basis!\nPREPARATION\nWell, that depends on how you want to tackle it!\nEither you can enroll yourself to any classroom program or you can do self study & join any online mock series next year.\nIn case you tag plan to along second choice, this is what you can do:\nEnroll to Career Launcher  & Takshzila shikshak  on YouTube!\nIf you can devote yourself to a classroom program later on, I'll suggest you to join Career Launcher, as the mentors there will work there ass off to assist & facilitate you.\nMeanwhile buy any good relevant topics related books (Arun Sharma for Verbal, Quant & LRDI) n target 1 topic each every day!\nAlso as you plan to start your prep form Feb-March, these are few things that can help you:\nRead a loads of good book from different areas/genres. This will make you well-read that comes handy given the number of RC questions CAT gives now. For the same please refer to this link containing this answer already shared.

This is how we have been delaying our CAT preparation to read about letters like these wherein we are assured to Crack CAT in a month or two. Believe it or not I wasted 9 months relying on such assurances, when one night a 22.1 %ile from a mock CAT hit my senses hard and woke me up from my much prolonged CAT fantasies. This fake 22.1% did change to real 94.8 but to note- everything changed since then. This is what happened\nThe transition phase:-\n1) Read, Read and Read is what I was told would help me, and I must say- It saved me.\n2) 1–2 hours of study on weekdays and 5 hrs of serious study over weekends.\n3) A daily dosage of Sudoku, The Hindu’s editorial page and Testfunda’s wordlist.\n4) VA ate my mind with a daily practise of atleast 50 questions\n5) Quantum CAT by Sarvesh K verma, a friend who walks me through all such possible questions that could trouble me in the CAT exam\n6) Frequent beer breaks to keep me alive :P\n7) TIME AIMCAT series to help you get a feel of CAT.\n8) Weekly 3 mock CATs\n9) Strength & Weakness analysis for my mock CATs (Weakness in my case :P). I used the analysis to devise a useful strategy- 60% time on strength and 40% on weakness.\n10) Admito (www.admito.in) - for choosing the perfect college. A must for every MBA aspirant.. Oh yes! They helped save much on what others knowingly spend on — college application& shortlisting.\nAnd lastly, I practiced well to calm myself down during such stressful situations upon which I feel CAT was nearing and so was my end. I believed in CAT as an extension to my experiences in the journey of life and dealt with it with a positive approach.\nCAT might have occupied 90% of your time as of now but after some time it would be MBA Admissions and lately dealing with your stressful schedule in MBA colleges.

For CAT strategy, two things are necessary: one is you focus on smart concepts, those that you can possibly apply in the exam time to save a few seconds; and the second is proper mock-examination ethic. To expand on the first, there are many possible ways to solve a question and some tricks might be necessary to build a good base of knowledge. Here, I will like to touch upon another topic, ‘Is coaching necessary to crack CAT?’ . I will like to answer this in a very realistic way, it is a post graduation examination and most of you would be busy with jobs and college studies. To cover all necessary tricks across these 10–11 months is nearly impossible if you go about studying from books only. Unless you have really good basics and supporting work-ethic, I will advice you to garner support in the form of a coaching. But, which coaching? This is a really important question. I took support from an online coaching, Elites Grid after extensive research on both online and offline coaching. It is a Delhi-based coaching and you can join the offline batch as well if you live in the vicinity. I will suggest you to look into it for some reasons as cited below:\n1: The faculty is exceptional: Hemant Malhotra, Shahzar Khan and Gaurav Kapoor are phenomenal mentors. Hemant Malhotra would take up Quants and LR-DI and Shahzar Khan VA-RC. Gaurav Kapoor will make you practice over questions from all three sections. The personal support throughout the preparation and doubt-solving with lengthy explanations slowly builds a great mindset for the final three hours.\n2: Question-base is exceptional: I have covered questions from TIME, IMS, Bullseye, TestFunda, Cracku etc. Though the TIME and IMS material is something I would still recommend, but they issue their basic packages in early season and though the packages are replete with questions, but the standard of these basic packages are not at par with CAT. There final packages for CAT and other exams are really good, but you get them in May-June, which is a bit late. Here, from the Day 1 you are exposed to questions ranging from Greenhorn to Brutal level, so you have an ample amount of time to build the right mind-set.\n3: Doubt-solving: This is one of the major parts of preparation for any competitive examination but is grossly underestimated. You might face a plethora of doubts through your preparation, and you would need someone to solve them with efficient methods. In offline coaching, you will have to wait up for a class, and by then you might lose out on the flow, but here, you can shoot up your query and both the mentor and the entire batch of students stand at your beck and call. Also, you get more than one approach to solve out the problem, which is absolutely perfect.\n4: Value of time: You will be preparing throughout an year and it matters what you gain out of this time. Though a 100 percentile seems enough of a reward right now for your hard-work, but trust me, you can get way more here. The mentors are both counsellors and they help you on conundrums bigger than a CAT score. This matters much more on retrospection.\nNow, coming to the second part the ‘proper mock-examination ethic’, this is another under-rated portion for the examination. CAT is much more about time-management and introspection on your skill-set than knowledge. Knowledge only gets you half-way through the path. You will need to work on your actual examination ethic and understand how you behave in the examination. Do you miss question that were easy? Do you spend more time on a harder set where you could have fetched double marks through easier ones? Should I read the passage or skim? Should I go with my gut? It is a never-ending list. The following points might help you to achieve the most of the mocks:\n1:Knowledge about your skill-set: What are you good at? Arithmetic or Geometry? RC or Para-jumbles? And so on and so forth. It helps a lot to know your strengths and weaknesses. Work correspondingly to get better results.\n2: Your attitude: This is one thing that is actually very important. Do I stick to questions and lose time? Am I biased in my approach to topics? Example, I used to find sets from Games and Tournaments very hard, so I used to never attempt them in first-go until one day I realised that I was attempting harder sets due to my bias on the topic.\n3: Proper paper-ethic and analysis: These mocks are not just to be done and left-out, they are to be analysed at length, the marks are not to be compared with peers but with yourself. There are three columns except the sectional and total scores and percentiles. First, “Comments”- Here you will jot down the overall analysis summary-like it was a brutal DI-LR but I did satisfactory. Made 1 silly mistake…..and so on. Second, “Sectional scope”- this would be how much could you have scored on a section more, REALISTICALLY. As in you wasted about 6 mins in a question and could not see the last three questions out of which two were easy. So your scope is +3 only, coz you did one correct, but you could have done two. Third is “Immediate Need”, here you will list out the major flaw. When you keep jotting this down, you get huge insights to work through your flaws.\nFocus on sectionals as well, for that go for sectional mocks. A combination of TIME and IMS mock-tests are recommended. Take an aim of 50 full length mocks and 30 sectional mocks for each section at least throughout the preparation. You can also try BullsEye for the start until IMS starts it mock-series.\nThe above strategy with mentors from Elites Grid helped me immensely to succeed.\nWebsite for Elites Grid: Elite Grid Academy\nCAT 2018 Strategy (Elites Grid) -https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=h...\nELITES GRID LINK OF CAT 2018 COURSE- Log into Facebook | Facebook\nYou might need to access the group for that place a request to join.\nLink for some recommended books, would be adding more soon\nBooks - Google Drive\nHope this helps, and ALL THE BEST.']"
How can we put our phones down to fully interact with each other again?

If people speaking on cell phones at other tables is such a nuisance, consider ordering your meal to go—although I’m not a fan of cell phones at a restaurant, I certainly would not want to see places start banning or restricting the use of a cell phone—except to reserve the right to take an order without the person chattering on a cell phone for any other reason than—what would you like me to bring you?

What are the best and fastest ways to increase my vocabulary for CAT level? How do I start and in what time intervals?,33 Answers,['Vocabulary Development\nWords\nCAT Preparation\nExam Strategies\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nWhat are the best and fastest ways to increase my vocabulary for CAT level? How do I start and in what time intervals?'],"['There was a time when questions like ""Out of the choices given, find the word closest in meaning to the one in bold in the passage given below."" were common in the Verbal Ability section of CAT. Or maybe they weren\'t; who cares. In the current format, the only questions that test your vocabulary are the questions that come under the reading comprehension and, if at all, find the word that does not fit the context heads. Again, I\'m not sure if the second category actually exists or is a figment of my imagination, but what one may infer from this is that you will always be asked word meanings in context. Standalone word meanings are a thing of the past.\n\nThe level of such questions ranges from extremely mediocre to tough. The idea, again, is to see how well you understand a word from the context in which it is mentioned. For instance, if I ask you to tell me what pulchritude means, you might think it has something to do with the squashing of a rotten tomato. However, if I were to say Scarlett Johansson is the embodiment of feminine pulchritude, you will understand in a jiffy that it means elegance or beauty or something in that region.\n\nSo we come to how one should go about developing this skill. In my opinion, the best way to go about it is to read a lot. Since you\'re in your third year of engineering (if you\'re a guy, god bless you), you can devote all the time you have allotted for CAT to development of your vocabulary. Pick up mature literature and unabridged versions of classics. The Shiva Trilogy might prove to be counter productive. Try reading Charles Dickens and Conan Doyle, since they\'re easy to read and are very well written. P. G. Wodehouse is another delightful author. I would also recommend people like Amartya Sen (The Argumentative Indian) and Jawaharlal Nehru (The Discovery of India; Glimpses of World History) since you\'re likely to get such passages in your test and this will also broaden your knowledge which is likely to hold you in good stead if you get called for interviews.\n\nAn excellent way to improve vocabulary is to look for word roots. For instance, fidelity, perfidy, infidel, bonafide and affidavit are words with a common root. Once you\'re familiar with lengthy and tough words, you can explore etymology. Again, it\'s a very interesting topic which will help you immensely when learning a new language. It will also make educated guessing a lot easier. In my case, I have never really bothered with word meanings. If you know what to look for and what functions prefixes and suffixes serve, you can guess word meanings with a lot of accuracy. Of course, there are exceptions. Restive, for instance, means restless which is fairly counter-intuitive. Yet, on the whole, this method works.\n\nLook at developing skills from a long term perspective. You can never be sure of performing very well in an exam like CAT. If you\'re going to change your habits, change them so that you may acquire something for the long haul. This way, you\'ll have more time to concentrate on other things - work, for instance - if you don\'t clear CAT and make it to the institute of your choice this time. As with everything else, try to learn as much out of this as you can. Be curious because, in the end, curiosity kills the CAT.', 'Vocabulary is like the ocean where each drop has its own value. Filling up something like an ocean is not easy it needs time and patience.\nReading is the best way to increase your vocabulary strength. Spend every day 30 minutes in reading editorials. You can refer to The Hindu, Economist, WSJ or Mint; they have well composed articles. I am sure you are going to come across new words every day. Read novels and try to complete one novel in a week.\nAs you read, make notes of the new words and its meanings, so that you can refer to it in your leisure times.\nMake use of these words in your conversations with your friends or in writings. This will help you in memorizing the words and store it in your mind forever.\nIf you find any word very difficult, try to make a quote with the word and use it in designing your mobile’s wallpaper. You can do this every day, this will help you in improving your art of writing too which will be useful in the later stages of getting into IIMs and other premier institutes.\nWatch English news channels.\nAs you asked, how to prepare for CAT, let me first suggest you some basic important things to keep in mind always.\nHave the grit to stick to the timetable no matter what comes in your way. (Excluding serious conditions :P )\nBasics is the foremost thing for CAT. Never jump into solving advanced level questions without being perfect in your basics.\nRigorous practice leads the way to success.\nPick one book; cover all the topics in it respective to a section. Preferably Arun Sharma’s books for CAT preparation. Never go for multiple books to read a topic, it will lead to scribbling your mind with unclear concepts and doubts.\nOpt for one online/offline course, which will help you in learning many tips and tricks as well as help you in clearly understanding the concepts and structure your preparation. You can refer to “Handa Ka Funda” online course. It also has doubts clarification live classes, which eases your CAT preparation from home and access to the video tutorials and materials anytime and anywhere.\nTake good relaxing breaks of 30 to 40 minutes after 2 to 3 hours of study. It is very important to refresh your mind to increase your grasping level.\nI have written few answers on Quora for CAT preparation with a brief study plan with respect to feasibility for a student and working professional. You can have look on the links below and I hope it helps you.\nHow do I prepare for CAT`16?\nWhat should be the approach for clearing CAT 2016 while working on weekdays?\nFamish for the best.\nGood Luck!', ""I have already written an answer for a similar question.\n\nHitanshu Malhotra's answer to How do I improve my vocabulary for CAT 2016?\n\n\nOne thing you should try to do is, try to make your preparation look effortless to you. Your schedule should seem natural to you.\n\nIf you end up feeling like you are doing something just for this exam or it’s a bitter pill to swallow, then reconsider how you are preparing.\n\nDeveloping a decent vocabulary for CAT is not that difficult. You can make it fun as well. You just need to develop right habits for this.\n\nThe easiest way to improve is through READING.\n\nStart reading novels (I know, it has become a cliche. But a cliche is a cliche for a reason). There are infinite books available. You can choose from any genre. ( If you require assistance in finding a good book to begin with, you can contact me. I try to read books of different genres, so might be able to help you ).\n\nApart from reading, you should study different word roots, prefixes and suffixes. ( A basic list is easily available on a simple google search)\nIf you develop a reading habit, you will solve a major issue that aspirants have : CONTEXTUAL USAGE.\n\nA lot of aspirants contact me to help them with this particular issue. However, there is no shortcut for this.\nInstitutes may provide you with a list of commonly used words, but they rarely help.\n\nMoreover, CAT is not going to ask you Antonyms and Synonyms. Questions are generally on contextual usage.\n\nSo, READ, READ, and READ.\n\nALL THE BEST!"", 'For the last 2 years, there are no questions on vocabulary. Whenever vocab questions are asked in CAT, they are always context based questions. So, mugging up words from word lists or dictionary wont be of much use.\nThe best way to improve your vocabulary for CAT is through reading but it is not the fastest way.\nYou can use “Word power made easy” to build your vocabulary. It is a very good book which focuses on understanding the context of the words as well rather than just memorizing them.\nAlso, you can join FB Group CAT Prep with IIM A alumni, daily we post an important word wrt to CAT.\nThanks for A2A.\nAll the best\nKamlesh Chauhan\nTrainer at BFactory Online Home Tutorial']"
How was the CAT 2018?,45 Answers,['Common Admission Test (CAT) 2018\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExams and Tests\nHow was the CAT 2018?'],"['Edit 1: I have updated the table and percentile predictions after having seen the actual paper as released by CAT.\nOriginal Answer: CAT 2018 was a beauty! VARC started innocuously enough, one had to be careful but if you picked the doosras and stuff it was very much possible to bat it out. Then DILR picked up momentum and took you on a merry ride. 1–2 do-able sets sitting inside a few fairly dicey ones.\nBut the story of CAT 2018 is entirely about the magical third section. Doing Quant was like facing a West Indian pace Quartet - at least I felt like that. I was mentally prepared for a grueling DILR section; and post this I was also mentally prepared for a Quant section akin to facing Dibbly Dobblies from New Zealand. I was geared to decimating Chris Harris and without warning I was suddenly facing Marshall and Ambrose on a Perth track from the 90’s.\nQuant was relentless\nThere no freebies, and almost every question was multi-layered. Gone were the “If Ram and Shyam take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, and Shyam and Krishna take cookies in the ratio 2 : 3, which of the following could be the total number of cookies?” of yore. The questions streamed down and were similar to\nAn alloy of copper and aluminum has 40% copper. An alloy of Copper and Zinc has Copper and Zinc in the ratio 2: 7. These two alloys are mixed in such a way that in the overall alloy, there is more aluminum than Zinc, and copper constitutes x% of this alloy. What is the range of values x can take?\nWherever possible, there was a minimum this or maximum that. And every now and then, as if the exam felt the need to rile you up more, it would throw the odd one from Logarithms or Functions. It was a classic paper. I might have enjoyed it more if I had been mentally prepared for it. As it is, by the time I realized how tough the paper was, I was at something similar to 26 for 5.\nFirst principles based learning would have helped. There was no use for any shortcuts-related nonsense. Speed in framing the equations was crucial and one had to have the confidence to power through numbers such as 7/19 and 5/14.\nVARC was a smidgeon tougher than last year, DILR perhaps a smidgeon easier\nVARC was not tough per se, but compared to CAT 2017 the passages were a touch longer and a touch trickier. Since the choices were also dicey, one had to be very careful. Students would have racked up a lot of attempts here, the accuracy variable will be uber-critical.\nDILR had 2 do-able sets and a few tricky ones. There were a lot of “MUST be FALSE”, “MUST be TRUE” type questions which are always a pain in the neck.\nPercentile Ranges - Expected\nKindly bear in mind that these have no statistical or rigorous basis. If we take +3/-1 for MCQ and +3/0 for TITA, I would guess the percentile numbers to be in the following ranges\nVARC - similar to CAT 2017\n99.5th percentile plus - 73+\n99th percentile – 66\n97th percentile – 60\n94th percentile – 54\n90th percentile – 50\n80th percentile – 40\nDILR - Also similar to CAT 2017\n99.5th percentile plus - 52+\n99th percentile – 42\n97th percentile – 37\n94th percentile – 30\n90th percentile – 24\n80th percentile – 20\nQuant - a step above what was seen in CAT 2017\n99.5th percentile plus - 54+\n99th percentile – 43\n97th percentile – 38\n94th percentile – 35\n90th percentile – 29\n80th percentile – 23\nOverall for CAT 2018\n99.5th percentile plus - 160+\n99th percentile – 140\n97th percentile – 127\n94th percentile – 115\n90th percentile – 100\n80th percentile – 75\nOnce again, these numbers are mere conjectures and the actual numbers could be wildly different.\nBest wishes for the results, folks.', 'Since the paper and the official answers are out, let me start with my scores in CAT18 (Slot 2)\nVerbal - 66\nDILR - 78\nMaths - 86\nTotal - 230\nIf I get a 100%ile it will be the 5th time in CAT.\nAbout myself:\nI am a Faculty who trains students fot Maths and DILR section.\nI have taken CAT number of times and my past performance is as follows\n100%ile (4 times) - 2007, 2009, 2016, 2017\n99.99%ile - 2015\n99.98%ile - 2008, 2011, 2014\nI usually write the exam to learn something, and there is a lot of learning from every CAT exam I write. The idea of this post is to list down my learnings.\nMy last two years score cards are as follows\nBefore going to the paper, the review of the first slot was that Verbal was simple, DILR was also relatively easy as compared to last year. Maths was really tough.\nBut over the years I have realised that whatever you listen to - ensure that you go with the flow of the paper and avoid predicting the paper.\nVerbal:\nHow I wrote the paper?\nWhen I started the paper, the language for the initial RCs was simple, but questions were tricky. Wasted a lot of time on the initial few questions. Then I realised my teaching to the studens, not to waste time on questions. Just mark what you feel is the answer after eliminating the options and move ahead. Though I followed the process still it did take time. Just finished the paper in time with a little haste in the last para jumbles. In the previous attempts I usually have 5 to 10 minutes in the end after I have gone through all the questions.\nPerformance:\n66 score in this paper looked fine. I am anyways not strong in Verbal. Did not have a good feeling with regards to Verbal. But considering that I have scored 99.9x%ile in verbal section in CAT15 and CAT16, I believe could have scored better.\nLearnings from the paper:\nDid a mistake of overthinking in the initial part of the paper. This ensured that I had to hurry in the parajumbles, which resulted in 3 out of the 4 parajumbles going wrong.\nI have realised over the years that when I read regularly before the exam I score better in Verbal. Last year and this year I have not been reading regularly. That is clearly reflected in lower scores in Verbal.\nDILR:\nHow I wrote the paper?\nI have scored 100%ile in the last 2 attempts in this section. Last year had attempted 8 sets whcih was a difficult section. Review was that this year the paper was easy. So was confident of solving 8 sets. First set was not so simple. took some time, but after some effort was able to complete the set. Second set had a lot of calculations. I built the complete framework on the paper. Could answer one question. But for solving others I had to do a lot of calculations. Was feeling lazy and I completely forgot about calculator. So skipped it and went to the next set. Now I had 2 minds if I could really solve all sets. So decided to pick easy sets and solve. Glanced through all sets and started picking up sets that I felt could have been done in short span of time. Was able to solve 5 more sets and with around 10 mins left I had 1 more set to go through and the 2nd set whcih I was not able to solve. I went to the 2nd set and was able to solve it. That left little time for the last set. Went through the set and solved 3 questions based on my understanding of the set.\nPerformance:\n78 is one of the highest score in this section this year. So should be able to get a 100%ile in this section third year in a row. I had total 31 out of 32 questions attempted with 4 answers wrong. 1 was in the last set which I did not solve properly. 1 where I solved it correct and marked it wrong. 2 questions from a single set where I was confident about the answer, but did some silly mistake. Overall did feel happy after the section as I was able to keep my head.\nLearnings:\nDont go purely based on prediction. Heard a lot of student panicked in DILR in 2nd slot as they had expected a relatively easy paper after the feedback from the first slot but turned out to be not so easy.\nWas prudent enough to leave 2nd set at that moment. Important to leave questions that are difficult as fast as possible to spend time on easy sets.\nMaths:\nHow I wrote the paper?\nMy previous year attempt in this section was that I had solved all questions but had 3 silly mistakes which resulted in score of around 90. The review was that the paper was much tougher than last year. So back of my mind I was prepared for solving lesser number of questions. But decided to solve the paper as it comes. I was able to solve the initial questions, but realised that I was taking too much time cross checking the answers as I heard the paper was tough. I realised that was a mistake. So stopped cross checking the answers and went full fledged with solving the paper as fast as possible. I did not face any hiccup in the paper. Only 1 question I left in between as I thought it will take extra time. Finished all the questions with 8 minutes to spare. Came back to that 1 question ans solved it. So with 6 minutes to spare I solved the entire paper.\nPerformance\n86 is a decent score, but could have done better. 34 attempts with 4 wrong. 2 questions I solved it correctly but marked the wrong answer. For 2 questions I used the correct method but did some silly mistake.\nLearnings:\nDon’t try to predict the paper. Go with the flow of the paper.\nIt is easy to solve a CAT paper without using Formulae or Equations.\nTips for preparation for CAT\nFor Verbal reading is the key to imporve. Read what you like and enjoy reading. Over a period of time you can read from diverse areas.\nFor DILR what is important is to build your ability in logic. Don’t only focus on CAT books but look at solving puzzles from different sources. Learning the right approach to solve DILR questions could boost your scores.\nI believe this is the area where a lot of students prepare incorrectly and hence are not able to do well in the exam. CAT exam does not test you on pure mathematics, but on how can you think logically. I have put up solution on youtube for CAT17 questions where I solved all questions with as far as possible not using exotic equations or formulae.I will do that for CAT18 too. These methods are quite simple and I have quite a few non engineers apart from engineers who perform really well in the exam using these methods. Expecting a few 99.8+%iles from my students.', 'Highlights of CAT 2018 Exam Analysis\nThere were no major surprises in the CAT 2018 exam. It was on the expected lines.\n 1) Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section.\n 2) Quantitative Aptitude was on the tougher side. The questions were lengthy and calculative. There were a lot of TITA questions as well.\n 3) Verbal Ability was on the easier side, as it has been the case for past few years\n 4) Overall the paper would end up being tougher than CAT 2017 because the impact of the difficulty level of Quant.\nCAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension\nQuestion Structure\n Reading Comprehension: 24 questions\n 4 passages (with five questions) and 1 passage (with four questions)\n Parajumbles: 4 questions\n Odd one out: 3 questions\n Summary: 3 questions\nAll Reading Comprehension and Summary questions were objective type questions.\n Parajumbles and odd one out were Type in the answer / Fill in the Blanks type questions.\nSo, a total of 27 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 7 did not.\nSummary The section was on the easier side. We could say that it was slightly easier than the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to do around 17-19 questions correctly for scoring 90%ile in the Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension section in the CAT 2018 exam.\nCAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation\nQuestion Structure\n There were 8 sets of 4 questions each. We can say that there were 2 sets of Data Interpretation and 6 sets for Logical Reasoning but the Data Interpretation sets required a lot of logic to solve them as well. It would be better to put them in the ‘Logical DI’ category, if something like that exists.\nA total of 24 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 8 did not. Also, these 8 Type-In-The-Answer type questions were distributed across multiple sets. There was no set that all 4 TITA questions.\nAs far as the difficulty level is concerned, it was on the difficult side. It was more or less the same level as CAT 2017. In my personal opinion, it is unfair to have one section significantly tougher than the other two. In a fair CAT exam, all sections would be of equal difficulty level. Clearly, that wasn’t the case in CAT 2018. As a matter of fact, that hasn’t been the case for at least the past 3 years since three sections were introduced.\n In CAT 2016, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section.\n In CAT 2017, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was tougher than CAT 2016.\n In CAT 2018, Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation was the toughest section. It was easier than CAT 2017.\n If the same pattern continues, it would be wise enough for students to develop a strategy which suits a paper like this. I hope this changes in CAT 2019.\nSummary This section was really tough. It was at the same level as CAT 2017. You would need to do around 9-11 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation section in the CAT 2018 exam.\nCAT 2018 Exam Analysis – Quantitative Aptitude\nQuestion Structure\n Arithmetic dominated the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam. There were 12-13 questions on it.\n Geometry, Algebra, Modern Maths were in the next tier with 5-7 questions.\n There were almost no questions purely on Number System (may be you could put 1 or 2 in the Number System category).\nA total of 21 questions had negative marking for incorrect answers whereas the other 13 did not. The number of TITA questions is higher than what it was in the earlier years and it is definitely higher than the number of TITA questions in the other sections.\nSummary This section was on the tougher side. You could say it was almost as tough as the LRDI section. People expect it to be much easier than LRDI but that wasn’t the case this year. It was definitely tougher than the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2017 exam. You would need to solve around 11-13 questions correctly to score 90%ile in the Quantitative Aptitude section in the CAT 2018 exam.\nExpected Cutoffs for CAT 2018 Exam\nTo get a 90%ile, we believe you would need the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 Exam\n Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension 17-19 questions\n Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation 9-11 questions\n Quantitative Aptitude 11-13 questions\nFrom an overall exam perspective, we believe you would need to the following number of questions to be correct (0 errors) in the CAT 2018 exam\n To get 90%ile 35-37 questions\n To get 95%ile 42-44 questions\n To get 98%ile 48-50 questions\n To get 99%ile 53-55 questions\nWe are also conducting a survey here for CAT 2018 exam.

The center was around 35 kilometers from my place. To ensure that I get a good sleep the previous night and to avoid travel hassles, I booked an OYO, which is a kilometer away from my center. I reached my center a good 45 minutes before the exam. 15 minutes before the start of the exam, my monitor stopped functioning. But, before I could start panicking, the exam authorities seamlessly moved me to an another system.\nSection 1: VARC\nVARC was the section in which I was highly inconsistent in the mocks. My performance in this section is entirely dependent on my state of mind at the time of taking the test. I managed to maintain a calm mind as the exam started. Wasting no time, I clicked on the Question Paper link and went through the entire section in a minute. The minor change in RC passages’ question distribution didn’t unsettle me and the presence of no RC passages from the dreaded genres of Art, Literature and Philosophy gave me a little joy. As I used to do in the mocks, I started solving the RC passages, sandwiching one or two VA questions in between the RC passages. I found the RC passages lengthier than CAT 2017 but the questions were not as tricky as CAT 2017. The section ended with 31 attempts with the three Para-essence questions left unattempted for the lack of time. This gave me immense satisfaction. But, the memories of last year wherein I ended up with a 93.51 percentile in this section after attempting all 34, killed that joy.\nSection 2: DILR\nThe favourite section - the one section which made me enjoy all the mocks I had taken in the two seasons of my preparation! A string of low scores in the mocks leading up to the D-Day made a dent to my confidence in this section. The section started with a venn diagram set. Straightaway, I went down to the business, made the diagram noting down the values. Three and half minutes down, realised that I am not getting anywhere in this set. Deciding to skip that set, I moved on to my second set, a pie chart set. The set seemed a sitter in the first glance but I trod cautiously taking nine minutes to solve this one. This gave me the momentum and the third set, a matrix arrangement one, was done in the next eight minutes. Next came a set of magic squares, with each question mostly independent of the other. Keeping this one as a filler for the end, I jumped to the last set without looking at the next three. The last set, a caselet about the denominations available in an ATM, was done and dusted in the next nine minutes. With thirty minutes down the clock and three sets pocketed, I was brimming with joy. I started navigating from the back, completing the seventh set - a set about contamination levels in 20 Petrol Pumps - and the fifth set - a DI sitter which involved calculating the number of people in each category of a committee - in eight minutes each. With 14 minutes left on the clock, I had to decide between the magic squares set and an another set about calculating the marks of ten students in three tests, which seemed a difficult one in the initial glance. I chose the marks calculation set, and riding on the momentum, I completed it in the next ten minutes. I filled the last 4 minutes with two questions from the magic squares set, ending the section with 26 attempts. “Sureshot 99.50+ here”, I told to myself.\nSection 3: QA\nThe weakest section - my mock scores hovered around 90~97 percentile in this section. But, I was high on confidence on the back of a strong DILR performance and on the expectation of an extremely easy QA section like that of last year. That’s the mistake I did - believing the section will be extremely easy instead of going with an open mind like I did for the other two sections. 40 minutes past, I was perspiring heavily on a cool Bengaluru forenoon, out of anxiety, with 9 half-hearted attempts and all 34 questions visited. This section had caught me completely unaware and it took me 40 minutes to dawn upon that the section was lengthy and not easy. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I managed another 7 attempts in the remaining 20 minutes. The last hour left me dazed.\nI went straight back to check out my room and boarded the bus to my place. Throughout the journey back, I retrospected on the test and concluded that the raw score vs percentile mapping will be similar to that of CAT 2016 scaled score vs percentile mapping with a 99 at 155, 99.6 at 170 and 99.9 at 190 for my slot.\n30th November:\nIIM C took a big leap towards increasing transparency(Or, a measure to reduce the number of RTI applications they have to deal with) by releasing the response sheets. I checked my QA score first. I was scoring 25, enough to let all the dreams of a C call, one of my dream institutes along with FMS, come crashing down. I was scoring 75 in DILR and between 60 and 74 according to various keys in VARC. “Hopefully, a 99+ overall”, I told to myself.\n7th December:\nIIM C released the much-awaited official answer key. My scores came out to be 78 in VARC, 75 in DILR and 25 in QA. “Had you kept your nerves in QA!”, I told to myself. With the candidates posting their scores in various forms online, I noticed that this year’s paper had done a good work in increasing the difference between the scores of a good candidate and an excellent candidate. I expect the difference between the scaled scores for a 99 percentile and a 99.6 percentile, which remained around 15 for the last two years, to go up to 20 this year. After coming across the scores posted online, I expect the raw scores for 99 to be at 160, 99.6 to be at 180 and 99.9 to be at 205 in my slot. Predicting is pure fun!']"
How do I overcome my depression and stress?,64 Answers,['Depression and Anxiety\nStress (psychological)\nCAT Preparation\nAnxiety\nDepression\nHow-to Question\nExams and Tests\nHow do I overcome my depression and stress?'],"['There are many science backed techniques to overcome stress and anxiety.\nFor starters, there are 2 primary Perspective Levers (PL) that you can change, and therefore change your perspective. These techniques will cognitively change your perspective and effectively alleviate your stress.\nHere are some concrete tactics to change your Time Perspective Lever.\nThis is essentially cognitively distancing yourself from the situation (by at least 1 year) and therefore alleviating the stress.\nFuture-self retro method: Imagine yourself and your business in a year from now. Now, as your future self, imagine you’re looking back to this time and to the situation that’s causing you stress. Write out answers to the following questions:\nWhat does your future self think about the current (stress) situation?\nWhat’s the stress rated now (0-10 scale) versus what’s the stress rated by your future self? Has the anxiety subsided?\nWhat does your future self know compared to your currents self?\nPast-self think back method: Recall a situation in the past, no less than a year ago, where you were dealing with a similar stress. Write out the answer to the following questions:\nAt its peak back then, how bad was the anxiety? What would your past-self have rated it (0-10 scale)?\nHow long did the anxiety and stress persist?\nAt what point did it subside?\nYou can find more details and tactics here:\n7 tactics for overcoming anxiety, by putting things into perspective\nAnd here are some concrete tactics to change your Thinking Perspective Lever.\nYou want to change your thinking to be MORE of a concrete mindset and LESS of an abstract mindset.\nList the means of an action (NOT the ends) - Ask yourself about what you did the day before. Write down what you did to achieve those tasks. If you had a meeting across town, you would write “walked to the station; rode the subway; timed my trip by looking at Google maps; paid $3 for an Americano.”\nLimit your mind wandering - Mind wandering has been linked to greater stress and negative emotions. To overcome that try:\nListen to background instrumental music, using Focus@Will or Brain.fm.\nDo games for executive function training, like this.\nHope you can give these a try and feel better.\nAlternatively you can also learn other specific scientific techniques here:\n6 steps to coping with stress using a personality-based approach\nCheers', 'In these days, we have various causes to have mental stress and depression.

You cure it. Dont weigh stress and depression on the same scale. You need to cure it. You need to calm your body’s reaction. Your need to cultivate positive thinking pattern. You need to have a relook at what you are eating. You need to forgive and forget everyone. You need to forgive yourself. You need to be aware of the environment that you are staying, is it contributing to your issues?\nAny doctor you go(alternative), show him this message and ask him whether there is any truth in the below, if affirmative try his treatment but if not cured within 1 year find another doctor. If the doctor says this is not true, i can assure you no use taking such doctors prescriptions, you may cure the symptoms but cause will remain.\nI can understand your situation but you have to realise that this is your own making albeit unconsciously though through your repetitive mind thinking habits and that which has been embedded in your subconscious mind. It is very very difficult to erase the negative thinking pattern you have cultivated but not impossible.\nYes, you need to go to the doctor, thats for sure but whether the doctor(not modern doctor only alternative) can cure you provided he/she knows his/her medicine.\nThe issue here what majority dont realise and majority of people who has reached chronic disease stages is that they will not realise it until they experience the change, then they realise that all the while their belief is wrong.\nAlso, in these cases, it is the mind that keeps you on the lease whereas it should be you who has to keep the mind on the lease till the time the doctor doesnt calm your mind, no cure is possible. Read on..\nYes, depression can be cured provided you are ready to change your belief and that is not easy and provided you are lucky to find a doctor who knows his medicine but it is not easy. Also, important that you change your unhealthy food to eating healthy food, forgive and forget, else one can never come out of it.\nYour mind and body is out of sync due to various factors including starts with negative thinking pattern, overthinking, a habit formed unconsiously due to many situations like environmentals as below mentioned, continuous negative thoughts drain you of your precious vital chemicals in the brain due to which Neurotransmitters in your brain get to a low level due to above and/or due to below. These are body’s chemical messengers. They are the molecules used by the nervous system to transmit messages between neurons, or from neurons to muscles and your unhealtlthy eating habits habits including, eating while watching TV, eating without chewing food properly, drinking water prior to meals and immediatly after meals, eating too much, areated drinks during meals, sugar laden foods, your air freshner chemicals, microwave, your neighbourhood environment and thousands of others in your day to day life contribute why you reached depression state and only escalate the situation you are in. Eating healthy food is in your hand but controlling the environment is not in your hand so think and remove those that are under your control.\nDepression is not overrated, in modern lifestyle it has multiplied by leaps and bounds. Negative thinking pattern cultivated in early childhood or due to environment in adulthood is one of the major causes in many cases, there are many other causes that contribute and make a perfect mixture for anxiety, depression and a host of chronic disease that you will believe hard to accept, believe it or not, for those who realise this truth, there is moksh(Nirvana) and alleviation from sufferings. Read on..\nPsychiatrist do help you but it is just temporary. Modern medicines are not to cure the cause, in majority it just ensures that the symptoms associated with depression, anxiety is subsided, it does nothing to cure the cause.\nDepression is not just matter of imbalance of chemicals, it means that your mind and body synchronisation mechanism has gone for a toss, connectivity is disrupted and you need to focus on repairing it. Now, the questions would be why it happened and how to cure it.\nIt starts with fight or flight response. It could start from a young age, growing up stage(familial environment, unhealthy food eating habits, wrong food combination, the air freshner, the plastic use, mobiles, and thousands of others in this modern fast paced life(you earn money only to fund your medical treatment) including the main cause YOUR NEGATIVE THINKING PATTERN formed through habits(like in a dysfuntional family, all those affected by the arguments/fight between husband & wife, could be children, relatives and any one in that environment who day in and day out gets to hear only negative matters and this is a negstive way of releasing stress), but exception is there, from dysfuntional families or environment too there are people who remain sane/positive thinking mentality because they chose the positive thinking pattern or it could be a sudden onslought but this also starts with the brain(environment and including all listed above). Depression means that it has reached a stage where your body is not able to handle all negative thinking pattern of onslought against it(it’s like in the border, if an enemy( Country A) attacks or infiltrates, the Border Security Force(Country B) will do everything to thwart the enemy’s infilteration attempt and succeeds everytime but what if the enemy goes on relently attacking, at some point the Border Security(Country B) is bound to be invaded, this is what happens when you go on a negative thinking pattern formed through habits(you form this habit invonsciously because when you hear something in the environment, its not only your conscious mind that is listening, there is a subconscious mind also taking in all the facts and your reaction to such stress). Thus, when negatively taken, you are not only corrupting your mind but body too. At the start, if you cannot handle stress in a fight of flight situation, it doesnot matter because your chemicals in the brain nerves are sufficient to handle it, but if such onslought goes on increasing, day and night, just before you go to sleep and on waking up, you are slowly paving the way for chemical imbalances because during your stress situation, brain communicates to body through chemical messengers and if you are on 24 hours guard what can you expect if not Anxiety, Depression, Schizophrenia and many other chronic diseases including diabetes, blood pressure, etc., due to chemical imbalances.\nSurrounding yourself with happy people is very good but those self-help groups who say to ostracize depressed people are completely wrong. Always remember, depressed people need you more than anyone else, could be his belief, he thinks you are the only person who listens to him and thus he comes to you, if you dont entertain him, he might have nowhere to go and could even take a drastic step, and before taking that drastice step, he/she may message you to get some response AND here you need to respond immediately and URGENTLY. BUT that doesnt mean you have to listen to his negative discussions, you can find ways to make him understand the negativity that he carries, books below mentioned might be useful. Read below:\nRead the book by Bruce Lipton - Biology of Belief, The Alchemist? The Secret and You can heal your Life, Blinded by Science by Mathew Silverstone, Breaking the Habits of being yourself by Dr. Joe Dispenza, The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle , Many Life Many Masters by Dr Brian Weiss and any books on meditations and most important prayers when you wake up, before you go to sleep. When you wake up, give thanks and gratitude for 10 things, it could be simple thing as waking which you have taken for granted or thanking your parents, etc.\nYour subconscious mind is like a hard disk of your computer yet 1000 times more powerful than computer, it saves all your emotions, habits, faith, memories and feelings and at appropriate time throws it out. Garbage in and Garbage out.\nClink on Best 50D sound fress mind use headphones for best sound effects (Best 50D sound fress mind use headphones for best sound effects (Best 50D sound fress mind use headphones for best sound effects)) use headphones and see the sound effects on both ears.\nEverthing starts with the word STRESS. Various forms of stress are there. The response to such stressful event occurs to maintain a balance. The body's stress response can be both helpful and harmful but in today's modern fast paced life, it is when such threat or perceived stress persists and in most families it persists, then it leads to chemical imbalances and to variety of diseases like Anxiety, Depression, Physchosis, Schizophrenia and even cancer. In those with above, the truth is that stress response does not stop.\nAnxiety and Depression is end result and fruit of negatively thinking pattern. Like you thinketh, you become. It means that the body has been tuned to this state by days, weeks, months and in severe cases years of negative thinking pattern. A 360 degree change of thinking pattern is the need of the hour but it is not easier than said. Human Being are not born depressed. These are not obtained from genes. It is the belief that one has acculmulated based on their toxic beliefs and thinking patterns about themselves and other people. When this false belief is untrained, you are on your way to getting CURED.\nFor majority of patient’s, without doctor’s intervention it is not possible to cure anxiety and depression. Modern medicine cures the symptoms but does not cure the CAUSE. Most of the time you become a slave to the medicine and you cannot function normally without it. Also, you will find that continuous use of antidepressants mitigates the efficiancy and stiil depression exist. Off course there are other side effects and give rise to other health conditions if used continuously. In case you are on antidepressant never stop. If you are going for alternative, reduce the dosage slowely if you feel alternative is effective. Never stop at once. For alternatives, read below.\nThe best option is Homeopathy or other alternatives like Ayurveda which cure the cause but but you really need to be lucky and make serious efforts to locate a doctor who knows his medicine because if the doctor doesnt know his medicine it can escalate the depression. Doctors you will find a many but a doctor who knows his medicine very few.""]"
Can an average student crack CAT?,86 Answers,['Average Student\nExam and Test Preparation Advice\nCAT Preparation\nExam Strategies\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nCan an average student crack CAT?'],"['Quite a few good answers here. Mostly motivational.\nBut let’s talk the basics.\nCan an average student crack CAT?\nNO. A Big NO.\nSome of the most intelligent minds I have met in my life belong to the IIMs and hence, I won’t sugarcoat things & say that an average student can crack CAT\nBut before you start judging me (or rather start hating me), I would ask you a question.\nWhat makes a good student and what makes an average student?\nI consider it to be mix of 3 parameters:\na. Ambition\nb. Intelligence\nc. Hard Work/Sincerity\nAn Average student usually is an average at all three (or rather bad at some & good in some). A good student, on the other hand, usually is average at some and damn good at others. He is never bad at any one of the parameters.\nAll those who are good at all three are fuckin geniuses and are out of scope for this question.\nNow, another question. What is CAT testing you for? And what do IIMs teach you to be? To put it very simply, they teach you to be damn good managers/professionals/entrepreneurs. Mostly, you will end becoming a manager in a reputed firm and will be handling a business which will 10 times your age - IN Crores. Now managers need to understand one thing very very clearly - They need to understand the importance of resources. Time, Money and Effort. If they learn to balance them well, they are good to go. If they screw up any one thing - They are screwed themselves.\nSo, CAT basically tests you on the same thing. It tries to look deep into you to understand the following things:\na. Where do you rank on the 3 parameters\nb. Do you know your strengths and weaknesses\nc. Are you willing to work and overcome them\nCan an average student do this? NO. A damn good one can.\nPS - Even if an average student ends up getting into an IIM (by sheer stroke of luck), he/she will perish in the 1st year itself. Trust me, CAT is the easiest part of your journey into one of the most prestigious institute in India.\nIs the brand name worth it? You bet it is!\nAll the best! Or Rather.. be the best!\nEdit 1 (Nov 25, 2016) - Getting some messages & comments highlighting that my answer is demotivating. Thought of clarifying a bit here.\nThe questions asks Can an average student crack CAT? It talks about an ‘as is’ scenario. Had the question been asking for motivational stories, it should have said What can an average student read or do or feel to crack CAT?. Let’s answer the questions the way they are instead of twisting the hell out of them and digressing.\n~Hate comments invited\n~Healthy discussions will get a beer!', ""Let me introduce myself. I consider myself an average student. I went to IIT (just got in, to be precise). I took CAT 4 times. I managed 99+ twice in CAT, without any coaching. My lowest sectional score was 75 percentile. With some efforts, I managed well above 99 percentile in that section in my last attempt. I have had interview calls from all IIMs except Bangalore. (No, I did not go to IIM for an MBA).\nAnswer in short : Yes. You can.  But, Work hard\nLong Answer: Firstly, I presume you want to get admission in an IIM. For that, clearing CAT will not suffice. Believe me, I got rejected in half a dozen interviews and I know 100 percentilers rejected by IIM.\nClearing CAT: As you would know, there are three sections in CAT exam. Prepare for all of them.\nThe Quant section was easy last time. This essentially means that if you solve hundreds of questions beforehand and remember all the formulas, this section will be a cakewalk for you. So, buy a question bank. Career Launcher  had online subscriptions. Check those out.\n[A risky advice: I think the expected score of randomly guessing answers for all questions with negative marks is 0. So, if you can eliminate a choice or two, your expected marks by guessing the answer is positive. I strongly suggest you to learn to eliminate choices. Eg: for a probability question involving 2 dice, the answer will most likely have denominators  - 36,18,12,9, etc. It is very unlikely for the answer to have 17 or 19 or 13 in the denominator.]\nThe DI section is relatively tougher. Again, with practice, this can be mastered. Get books with tough problems, like Arun Sharma.\n[For questions involving seating arrangement, attribute matching etc, the options in the following questions may give strong hints which may be helpful to derive the arrangement. Learn to use those.\nI strongly urge not to guess blindly for line graphs or bar charts. If you must mark without real calculation, stare at the graph for 3-4 seconds before marking the answer]\nSame goes for the verbal part. Practice. Last time, there were only sentence arrangement and reading comprehensions. So, start reading. And start writing.  Read quality articles. The Hindu editorials may be a great place to start. Else, google for project-syndicate. Increase your speed at which you read (comprehend). Don't worry, I do not have a great reading speed. Increase your vocabulary. Start thinking in English. Start talking in English. Meanwhile, perfect your grammar.\nI have heard that TIME material is the best. Get access to that. Beg, Borrow or Steal. Join mock test series. www.hitbullseye.com has some awesome free material. (This is the only coaching which I had). You can get a lot of GMAT material online. Install a vocabulary building app in your phone.\nTo increase your speed, install apps in your phone - brain wars, Lumosity etc. Do not go for the paid versions. Practice everyday for half an hour. The pace at which your brain fires will go up drastically.\nPractice. Be honest to your plans. Be systematic. You will clear CAT with 99+ percentile.\nNow, as said earlier, CAT score alone will not get you an admission. Make a good profile.\nYou should be prepared for the interview - Why MBA? Why this IIM? What value addition can you bring to the class? Strengths? Weaknesses? Regrets in life? Short term and medium term goals? Current affairs?\nMake a great profile. One which stands out. Do one or two relevant specialization in Coursea (they give free certificates, if you meet their criteria) if your academics are not great.  Tell them you know VBA and python. Work for an NGO (this got me a job offer which I had to decline). Learn a foreign language. Do a project which sounds great or which has significance for everyday life. Listen to and learn a course from open course  website which is relevant for MBA (Like microeconomics from MIT or Game Theory from Yale or OR from NPTEL). Have a hobby. (not solving puzzles alone please. Half the people appearing for the interview claim that they can solve puzzles). Learn to talk well (with varying modulation and accepted pace of speech). Dress well for the interview(believe me, at least 20% of the guys whom I met at the interviews were not dressed properly). Smile. Perfect your body language. Make the interview a discussion and not Q&A.\nMay the force be with you."", 'Yes, definitely. CAT is totally a different exam. The topics are very general and to crack CAT, you just need good preparation and a strategy for individual sections and then its very easy to clear CAT with 99 percentile.\nBeing an average student does not affect your percentile and therefore should not affect your preparation.\nIf you are dreaming to crack CAT with good score you need a plan of how to start and to finish of this race leading yourself on the top.\nCAT is the most familiar MBA entrance test. Every year more than 1.5 students registers for CAT but only few of them crack it with 100%ile and get the chance to enter in one of the prestige institutions like IIMs, FMS, ISB etc.\nNow the question is HOW TO CRACK THE EXAM?\nCAT includes 3 sections:\nVERBAL ABILITY – 34 Questions (60 minutes)\nDATA INTERPRETATION\nAND LOGICAL REASONING – 32 Questions (60 minutes)\nQUANTITATIVE ABILITY – 34 Questions (60 minutes)\nPlus one mark on every right answer and minus one-third marks on every wrong answer.\nTo crack the exam with 100% you must follow a simplified approach for your preparation. Here are some tips that will definitely lead you to score good.\nSo firstly divide the three sections and put emphasis on each one according to your comfortability with the section.\nPART 1: VERBAL ABILITY: The verbal section in CAT not only tests the Grammar and English of a candidate but also the critical thinking skills. Since the last 3 years, VA-RC is one section in which candidates have particularly faced difficulty. In this post, we give you a guide on how to approach Reading Comprehension in the Verbal Section and the pattern for the section in CAT 2018\nDISTRIBUTION OF QUESTIONS:\n6-7 questions on error correction\n5-6 questions on jumbled paragraphs\n4-5 questions on facts, inference or judgment\n3-4 questions on para summary\n15-16 questions on reading comprehension\nPART 2: DATA INTERPRETATION AND LOGICAL REASONING:\n1. Quick Calculations and approximations– This is specifically true for DI section. Be sure to do as much as mental calculations as possible and memorize things like squares, cubes, roots, fractions and percentage conversions. You can use approximations up to 1% in your calculations as the options in CAT are general varied by at least 3%. For ex, you can use 3 instead of 3.453 to speed up calculations.\n2. Focus on keywords: There are a few keywords that can completely change the meaning of a statement. Some words that should be paid attention to are: all, some, none, other than, only, unless, if and only if, and some prefixes like non-, un-, dis- etc\n3. DIAGRAMMATICAL APPROACH: You should organise the information in a systematic manner by using tables, symbols and diagrams. This minimises the work involved and helps you solve a different set of questions based on one main problem. The symbols used should be such that they convey the proper meaning to you as given in the question\n4. Don’t get stuck in a Question: It is quite possible that while scanning, you choose a data set that looked simpler, but while solving, it turned out to be tough or highly calculation-intensive. You should detach yourself from the data set as soon as you find it very tough or time-consuming, even if you have invested time in it.\n5. Use Options – Be sure to look at the options before you start solving the questions. It will help you eliminate some of the variables which are not a part of the options and, more often than not, includes clues which will help you solve the answer in less duration.\nPART 3: QUANTITATIVE ABILITY:\nWhen you start preparing for quants and start progressing through topics, it is advised to have a personal formula bank with yourself. There are always more than 1 way to write a formula, keep the formula bank handy with the the formulas that suit you the best\nA lot of times, rather than solving questions, it’s possible to get the answer by plugging in the values given in the options than working out from the actual algorithm.\nThere are a number of tricks for speed maths. Go through these as they are really handy\nWhile practicing problems, identify your weak areas and keep a track if there has been some progress in the topics. If the mistakes are recurring then evaluate on WHY this is happening. It might be a case of a conceptual gap rather than a question-to-question mistake.\nWhen you are done with individual section preparation, move to mocks and try giving as many tests as you can. Here are some tips to that:\nPREPARATION:\n1. Mocks: In every mock, always aim to solve at least 50% of the test in the stipulated time. This allows you to give ample amount of time for each set and improve accuracy.\n2. Fixing approach for different types of questions: There is a limit to the sets that can be made. Exposure to variety, traps, and fixed approaches to problems will help you do well in the section. Also, focus on the thought process.\n3. Practice: Along with your preparation for QA and VA, be sure to devote at least 1-1.5 hours and solve 2 sets of LR and DI each. Be sure to experiment with different approaches to discover the one that suits you the best.\nLR & DI COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE FOR CAT 2018\nHow to Prepare for Quantitative Aptitude to crack CAT 2018 - MBA Preparation\nGo through this plan and you will definitely crack CAT 2018.\nAlso, here are some tips and tricks which you should follow while preparing for CAT.\nTip 1. Take mock tests in an online environment\nYou must take computer-based mock CAT so that you are familiar with the actual test environment. Start taking the mock CAT as they will make you feel in the real environment and completely help you to prepare and save any wastage and you will be able to learn many tricks of how to solve the questions, which type of questions to be opt first.\nTip 2. Analysis and Evaluation is mandatory\nAfter every CAT mock test, you must analyse your performance and evaluate your scoring areas based on CAT exam pattern.\nShiv Raj an IIM CALCUTTA student and 99.94 percentiler in CAT shares, ""Whenever you take a mock test, assess not only the wrong questions but also the right ones. Sometimes you may score very high, while on other occasions you might get a low score.\nTip 3. Find your strength and weakness\nTo prepare for CAT 2018, it is very importance to identify your strengths and weaknesses. Going by your own evaluation, you must focus on your strong areas and start working on that. As most of the questions in CAT are based on the application of basic concepts such as linear equation, probability, permutation and combination,(in quant), learning both concepts and application of all the topics at this stage is not advisable if you are aiming to crack CAT 2018.\nTip 4. Practice, Practice and Practice\nCAT Experts suggest that you must practice a lot so that you can make an instant connect with the question during your CAT exam day. Regular practice in a right direction will not only help increase your question-solving speed but also make you habitual to sit for three hours.\nCHHAVI GUPTA, one of the two female CAT 2017 toppers who secured 100 percentile mentions, ""I rigorously practised the Mock CAT series, selected some random tests online and sample CAT. To be precise, I solved 35 practice tests and analysing them critically.""\nTip 5. Set your Targets\nCAT pattern is always similar to its previous one and CAT 2018 is expected to be like 2017. So candidates should do SMARTWORK and focus on targeting the minimum and maximum number of questions that you will be attempting during CAT 2018. Around 20 questions in each the sections can take you to around 98 or 99 percentile in CAT but you should be open up in those sections which are your strengths.\nMayank Raj, 100 percentiler, CAT 2017 shares that he had attempted all questions from Quantitative Ability as it was his strength area accurately followed by DI & LR and VARC.\nTip 6. Time management\nWith 60 minutes allotted for each section during your CAT test duration, you should first attempt the questions which you can solve quickly. If you are doubtful on a question at the first glance, you leave it in the first round and come back to it in sequence after you have completed the first round of attempts. As you quickly solve a few questions, it will inculcate a higher level of confidence to attempt the difficult questions during the second round of attempts. Sharing his section wise time management strategy regarding how to prepare for CAT 2018,\nMadhur Gupta, CAT 2017 100 percentiler says, ""In DILR, I focussed on question wise approach. Did the easier questions of the set and marked the tough ones of later consideration. In this was completed five sets and later came back to the tougher questions. I found this very convenient. Quant and verbal sections were too easy for any strategy. You either knew the answers or didn\'t know them.""\nTip 7. Accuracy is very important\nPrioritizing the questions is becoming one of the key areas to success. As you go on attempting questions during your CAT, make sure that you compromise very little on accuracy, as there is negative marking on each wrong attempt,so you have to be very cautious and very confident while answering any question.\nNikhil Singh, IIM Shillong PGP 2017-19 batch student says “ My basic strategy was to attempt as many questions as possible. Even though there was a slight compromise with the strategy but it ended up attempting 90% questions with around 70 percent accuracy.,”\nTip 8. Leave the questions\nIn case you find questions a little difficult during the second round of your attempt, and are not sure about the answer, try to leave it. But yes, sometimes you can find the answer by analysing the options. So this strategy can also be followed.\nSai Praneeth Reddy, another 100 percetiler of CAT 2017 mentions, ""I started with DILR but I found that first few questions were really tough and time-taking. So, I skipped first four questions. Gradually, I realised that skipping questions won’t lead me anywhere. Then I started from the last question and started solving followed by whatever I could answer first.""\nTip 9. Relax and BE focused at your D-day\nYou should prepare well before your date with CAT. Spend a day before the test in a stress-free environment. You should meet your friends and relax the way you like.Once you enter the test centre keep yourself focused on the test and maintain calm.\nPranit Arora, who secured 100 percentile in CAT 2015 says, “It is important to stay relaxed and not get nervous for the test. Stress leads to failure which must be avoided. So do not overthink, stay calm and confident.”\nBefore the exam day, it is extremely important to keep your cool and rest properly.”\nFocus on maximising the number of attempts with high accuracy. Leave the rest on to your honest effort.\nFor preparing CAT 2018, You can join the course Eckovation\nThis course includes concept videos, mock test with good material. It will really benefit you.\nFor more information on - MBA Preparation How to prepare for CAT 2018 in less than 6 months? - MBA Preparation\nHope it help you.\nAll The Best:)', ""YES.\nHow?\nMental power is more important than intellectual strength in respect to cracking CAT. When you are psychically strong, you will be ready to make any challenging moves. If you are low in believing that you can, then you can never make it happen. Eternally remember the competition should be with you not with the world. When you compete with yourself you explore yourself and develop your abilities. This certainly drives to success and credits to your hard work.\nCAT:\nThe word itself brings so much of heaviness (although C means Common!) and one starts suspecting if he can or not. A student cracking CAT with 100% is a genius holding in himself and making an effort beyond the limits (rest is history). So, motivate yourself well enough that you work remarkably hard which makes you proud.\nHere comes a question again, I have seen many students working hard spending a year or two but they don’t make the way to IIM. What now? Aren’t they sincere and hardworking? Thomas Alva Edison before making a bulb failed more than 100 times! But that doesn’t mean he wasn’t doing the right hard work. It is just that our life seems short to take CAT more than 4 times because there is a lot in life to do. You can obviously use that sharpened brain in many other tests and competitions in life.\nQ: Who is an average student?\nA: The one who can solve anything but takes time.\nQ: So, how can he crack CAT?\nA: By giving time to sharpen his skills.\nHow to prepare for CAT?\nPlanning: Structure a plan that will help you carry on the academic/professional/personal life along with CAT preparation smoothly. As you are the one who takes time in grasping things, so start your preparation early i.e., at least before 6 months.\nBooks: Choose your books wisely. Do not start preparing for a topic from different books. Choose one book and try completing it wholly.\nOnline/offline course: Rely on one course and make use of it entirely. Do not hesitate to ask questions to clear your doubts. If possible be in a group of students always who are preparing for CAT. Spend more time in understanding and solving a difficult question yourself, this will help you explore ideas and learn many ways of solving a question. I would suggest you opt for “Handa Ka Funda” online course, this is an awesome aid for beginners. It's video tutorials are easy to understand and helps in moving fastly to advance level of questions. The doubt clarification classes help you clear your doubts as well as discover additional helpful things.\nDedication:\nDedicate time to each and every section and never let any subject rest. Always keep revising even the easiest part. Mocks are the heart of CAT preparation. Scrutinize each mock thoroughly to identify your strengths and weaknesses.\nHope this helps. All the best!""]"
"How should I start preparing for CAT 16 all over from scratch without joining any institute beginning in July? Can anyone suggest a study plan, books and materials, mock test and preparation guides?",19 Answers,"['CAT Preparation 2016\nCAT (Common Admission Test) 2016\nMBA Students\nMBA Preparation\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I start preparing for CAT 16 all over from scratch without joining any institute beginning in July? Can anyone suggest a study plan, books and materials, mock test and preparation guides?']","[""There are a lot of students who study for more than 1 year for CAT, and then there are also those who crack the exam by preparing for 3 months. I have come across quite a few examples of students who have studied for just 3 months and managed to crack the exam and make it to some of the top IIMs. But the time that has to be given per day could be atleast 4 hours on a regular basis. Here I am going to discuss a plan to prepare for CAT with 4 months to go i.e. if you start preparing from mid July, how do you go about it.\nI would broadly breakup the preparation into three parts. First the syllabus, second mocks and analysis and third mocks and revision.\nTime frame for each is as follows:\nSyllabus – 1.5 months\nMocks + Analysis – 2 months\nMocks + Revision – 0.5 month\nFirst Stage – Syllabus:\nQuants: When you are trying to complete the syllabus, spend around 1 to 2 days on a topic. Avoid spending more than that. If you spend more time here you will get less time for the second stage which important for cracking the exam. Solving around 15 to 30 sums per topic would suffice. Solve less sums on the topic you are comfortable with and more sums on the topic you find difficult. Spend around 3 days in these 45 days solving mocks – once every 15 days - to see if you are going in right direction and to know your strengths and weaknesses. Rest of the 42 days spend time on your preparation. Spending around 1.5 to 3 hours a day on Quants (1.5 hours if it is a strong area and 3 or more hours if it is a weak area) should suffice.\nVerbal: It is important that you spend enough time on reading as part of your verbal preparation as CAT mainly tests you on comprehension of passages. In CAT15 there were 24 RC questions from the total 34 Verbal questions. Need not do vocab, unless you are from vernacular medium or really find the need for it. CAT does not focus too much on Vocabulary. Apart from that you can do a little grammar. Don’t get into too much of grammar as it could be quite confusing. If you come across something important or commit some mistakes in the questions, write it in a book and go through it regularly. You can create schedule as follows:\nApart from the above solve 1 or 2 RC passages and spend considerable time on reading everyday.\nRoughly 1 to 1.5 hours on the topic of study, 0.5 hrs on RC passages and 1 to 1.5 hrs on reading.\nDI and LR: A good way to practice is to solve 1 question of each DI and LR everyday. Can focus on the following topics on DI/LR.\nMaximum 1 hour on DI and LR combined per day should suffice.\nWhat I have given above is the rough sketch with regards to preparation for the basics. Dont get disheartened if you fall behind schedule. Do as much as possible everyday without saturating yourself.\nThere are others who are working and cannot give enough time. For them they need to proportionately reduce the time spent on each area, but ensure that you give maximum time to your weak area.\nSo assuming you will cover it in 1.5 months, you still will have 2.5 months to go for the exam.\nFor the next two stages, can refer to the following link: Patrick Dsouza's answer to I have finished with my basics, how do I plan my remaining time with 2.5 months left for CAT?\nIf you want to join Facebook group for CAT preparation -https://www.facebook.com/groups/cat100percentile/\nFor free WhatsApp group for CAT Preparation, WhatsApp to 9821314788.\nWebsite: www.patrickcat100percentile.com"", 'CAT 2016 is expected to be held in November 2016 which gives you around 5 months to prepare. As you don’t want to join an institute for preparation, I suggest you explore some online preparation options.\nPreparation for CAT involves 4 stages:\nGetting well versed with every basic concepts of the syllabus\nDedicate the month of July and mid-August to understand the concepts and practising the easy to medium level questions. You should make a strict study plan for each day. Also keep the other stuffs like weekly dose of entertainment, parties in mind while preparing your schedule. Accounting these stuffs makes your plan more realistic and practical to follow. Divide the CAT syllabus into small sections and try to complete each section within a week. Track your preparation. Get a excel sheet made where you analyse what you practice with data points like Questions solved in the week, Average accuracy of a topic, your strengths and weakness, important formulae and tricks for easy calculation. I would suggest that you can get started with online material of PRAQTISE because they have an adaptive algorithm and it gives analysis of what you practice and they have study plan feature. So the website will track your weekly preparation and no need to do extra effort for tracking your progress. You can try out books of TIME and CL. They have good quality questions. Bookmark the questions which you think is important.\n2. Strike while the iron is hot\nBy mid of August, you should be well versed with the concepts and what you require now is practice till August end. Mould yourself to difficult questions. Try to solve sectional tests. Know your strengths and weakness. Work on your weakness as this is the time when you will start developing the comfort level with particular sections or topics.\n3. Take MOCKS\nSimulating the test environment is an important aspect. Start giving mock tests. Mocks of TIME are on difficult side (more difficult than actual CAT themselves), IMS and CL mocks are CAT level mocks. Analyse your mocks till death as it will give you clear idea of your strengths and weakness, strategy to attempt a mock, time management. You should try out multiple strategies for improvement and see what works best in your favour. Every person adopts a different strategy. There is no strategy which guarantees success. The best suited strategy should be applied to last 5–6 mocks which will eventually give you confidence to go forward with your strategy in actual CAT. Always have a plan B if plan A fails. Try to take at least 15 mocks. Don’t give multiple mocks in a day as your brain needs rest and you need time to anaylse your test and work on weakness and strengths.\n4. A week before CAT 2016\nIt is advisable to not to solve any mocks in the penultimate week as the performance in the mocks will affect your mindset and you won’t be able to give your 100% during CAT due to fear of those mock results. Don’t try to solve any new topic. Suggested thing to do is to revise the formulae and the mocks which you have given. Go through the bookmarked questions.\nDon’t solve or revise any questions just a day before. I know it feels weird but trust me you will do no good in a day, so avoid doing anything bad. Just as the saying goes ’ Rome was not built in a day’ . Chill around with your friends but please don’t get drunk or don’t overeat a day before.\nGet up fresh on D-Day and calm yourself as a steady mind always gives better result than a mind with fears. Give your 100% in CAT. Come home, no discussion on CAT. Give yourself a treat (you deserve one!) for enduring the 5 months of preparation for the one of the toughest exam in India.', 'The time after engineering is the best to prepare for CAT, because you are far away from the job responsibilities and all set to make your career through CAT without any second thought. Devoting the upcoming four months for preparation entirely will surely lead you in cracking CAT.\nStudy Plan:\nYou can choose Arun Sharma’s books respective to the CATs different sections. Refer to online course “Handa Ka Funda” for structuring your CAT preparation. It will help you in the self-preparation a lot. The live doubt clarification classes will help you in clarifying your doubts as you are starting from the scratch. Listed below is a detailed plan for starting from the basics and then slowly stepping to advance level of the CAT preparation.\nJULY:\nEditorials - I suggest you to start your English preparation with a determination to read editorials every day. Read two editorials from a newspaper like The Hindu, Mint, The Economic Times, etc.\nNovels - Start reading a fiction novel of authors like Khaled Hosseni, Jeffrey Archer, etc. Later start reading non-fiction novels.\nMake notes of the new words you have come across and its meaning. You can do the respective using app Evernote, which would help you later going through it anywhere & anytime.\nStrengthen your basic grammar and practice sentence completion through the video tutorials. Kaplan’s GMAT book for “Sentence Correction & Reading Comprehension” will hone your skills in RC section.\nAUGUST – You are ready to practice advanced CAT level questions.\nSEPTEMBER:\nOCTOBER:\nMake notes post the test for the reasons leaving a question unanswered or answering it wrong. This will prevent you from making repetitive mistakes. Opt for TIME’s mock test series as they have a larger audience enrolled in their mocks which will help you to gauge your performance with respect to serious aspirants.\nNOVEMBER:\n“All you just need now is Rehearsal”\n“Practicing helps in learning and analyzing rehearsals helps polishing your practice for the final performance.”\nSo take mock tests twice a week, do-good revisions of the notes you have made until now. The mock tests for “Handa Ka Funda” available after the notifications of CAT is released are of CAT level and I recommend to take them to analyze your strengths and weaknesses.\nRelax a week before the final test, don’t take too much stress just go through basics and notes.\nKeep Calm & Believe in Yourself. Strive for the best.\nThanks for A2A. Hope I helped I you.\nGood Luck!', 'If you are preparing without any coaching then I would recommend you the following way to do so,\n1.Grammar: For this there is no shortcut, you can learn techniques to make your learning process easier but no certain shortcut to your immediate goal. The book I would refer you for grammar is Wren and Martin, ETS guide for GMAT and some sample test papers. Now do these books as given in order and you will be thorough with your grammar command in about 3–4 months. Learn grammar from the bottom of your heart and most of the topic that you will come across are already covered in your school life and might not need much attention.\n2. Vocabulary : Now, vocab is not the most concentrated portion of your paper but an average Indian candidate does not necessarily have a wide range of words under his or her belt so it is good to devote as much time possible. learning and mugging up words are 2 different things and need to addressed differently, so please try to understand the context the word is being presented in rather than focusing solely on meaning. Pickup the material for reading that lies in your comfort zone and mark the words that you find new, later find the roots and antonym and synonym for the same and this is the process you need to follow. The books that I would refer to you for this very reason are; Word power made easy and the ETS guide for GRE . It is not necessary that you will have to devote same amount of time on this section, if you have less time left for this reason and want to brush up on some vocab then I would recommend you to download an app called VoLT ( Vocabulary learning Technique) this is something that I stumbled upon while my prep for CAT and I personally found it very useful as it has pictorial presentation of words, roots and what not. Accessible anywhere and everywhere is just a perky bonus as well.\n3.Logical Reasoning; Now this section as suggested by name is dependent on ones logical aptitude and I would recommend to buy a correspondence pack of some coaching institution that you find reputed enough. Just like quant and grammar, there are no shortcuts for success in this section and one needs to keep on practicing until mastered.\nAs far as the quant and DI section is concerned you can start preparing in the following pattern, (Assuming that you have a decent enough basic knowledge of Maths till 10th)\n1.Practice material of some coaching institution that you find reputed enough, as they make these material as per latest pattern and are really helpful to determine the difficulty and what not.\n2.Solve past year papers\n3.Quantitative Aptitude for the CAT Common Admission Test by Arun Sharma for simple and easily understanding purpose\n4.Quantitative Aptitude Quantum CAT Common Admission Test for Admission into IIMs by Sarvesh K. Verma\nNow please dont make a schedule where you find youself studying for 4–5 hours non stop daily or even 2 days a week, scatter your preparation for a longer duration but please make the duration of studying per day a little close to 2–3 hours.\nAIMCATS from TIME is good as well.']"
Why do cat experts say not to punish a cat as they can't remember anything; yet they hide in the bedroom after tearing through the trash?,6 Answers,"[""Cat Litter Boxes\nDog Training\nCat Behavior\nDog Behavior\nAnimal Behavior\nCAT Preparation\nCats (domestic)\nDogs (pets)\nPets\nAnimals\nPsychology of Everyday Life\nPhilosophy of Everyday Life\nWhy do cat experts say not to punish a cat as they can't remember anything; yet they hide in the bedroom after tearing through the trash?""]","['Here’s the deal. Cats, just like dogs, will only associate being told no, or punished to stop behavior you don’t like if you catch them in the act of doing something wrong. There are things you can do to stop cats (and dogs) from getting in the trash, but my advice is to get covered trash cans. Punishments for cats should be no more harsh than a firm “NO!”, or being squirted with water. With kittens and very bad behavior I have gently grabbed the scruff of the neck and shaken them lightly (not in the air) because this is how mom cat used to discipline them. There are lots of creative ways you can make bad behaviors less rewarding for cats. (Counter surfing, garbage fishing, curtain climbing, sharpening claws on the furniture instead of the cat post and MORE. ) Google it. Punishing any animal after the fact is a waste of time, and just leads them to fear you. Yes, they are hiding because they are reading your body language and scent, and know you are not happy. Some dogs might know they’ve done something wrong, but punishing them after the fact isn’t going to stop the behavior either. As someone else said, animals live in the moment. I will voice my displeasure with a dog when I come home to mayhem and destruction. “Who did this? Someone was so BAD!” Cats are just going to hide, or wash. Because they don’t really care if you rant and rave. Trust me on this.', 'She’s hiding from you because she senses anger and she’s afraid of you. She has no clue what it’s about.\nCats don’t make complicated mental connections. If you yell at her when she is doing something, it may make her not want to do that thing again. If you yell at her five minutes later—even one minute later— she won’t have a clue why you are doing that. She doesn’t have the reasoning capacity to follow the chain of cause and effect to make sense of it. (Neither does a child, necessarily, but when we punish a child we tell him why we are doing it.) You are just a scary person who yells at her.', 'Its not that they can’t remember, its that unless you say NO right while they’re doing something, they only know what it is you don’t like. Cats are in the here and now, and they associate/connect certain things with certain actions, that’s how they’re hard-wired. Have you ever been scolded and not known what you’ve done wrong because you’re not doing it right then? Cats are like that; they connect food with the sound of a can being opened; they see you bring out the carrier and they know its for a trip to the vet (good luck in catching your cat then!', 'I think the not remembering part is wrong. At least in the situations where they are caught in the act or immediately after the act, my cats clearly know what they have done.\nThe problem is they are usually seeking attention. Good, bad -- doesn\'t matter. If you punish them, by whatever means, you are giving them attention and thus reinforcing the behavior.\nThat\'s why whenever possible I ignore the bad behavior. I will usually take steps to prevent a recurrence of it, but I resist overt punishments. Although there is nothing that my cats hate more than being ignored, so in a way, they actually are being punished.\nMy one exception, and it goes against expert advice, is the squirt gun. The experts say this can damage your cat\'s psyche and never to use it, but I keep one around for “emergencies"". If, for example, the cat has jumped on the stove and it has a burner on, I will squirt them down.\nI\'d rather risk damaging their psyches (although for the record this does not appear to be a problem) than see them physically hurt.\nSusy exploring the cat superhighway.']"

While I would recommend you Career Launcher's series, other products from established institutes too serve the purpose.\nThe most critical part in taking mocks is the post-test analysis. This will help you identify your strong and weak zones and hence would help you formulate an effective time management strategy. Remember that you don't have to attempt every question to land yourself in FMS or other top B Schools. Accuracy and speed matters and these can be developed by devising a good time management strategy.\nAll the best for CAT 2017! Hope my answer helps."", 'Well, the things that work best in life are the ones that are simple. The more you complicate matters, the greater the chance of bungling up. To help you out, and keeping simplicity of approach in mind, I have a set of reminders for you.\n1. Time to focus on your strengths\nIf you look at the overall syllabus, all topics can be divided into three areas for any student:\nStrong areas/topics\nIndeterminate areas/topics (neither strong nor weak)\nWeak areas/topics\nWith us in the last lap of preparation, it is time for you to focus on weak areas. There is not much that can be done about them. The maximum you can do for these areas is to revise the basic concepts and that is pretty much about it.\nYour maximum focus should be working on your strong areas and using these to boost your scores. Also, work on your gray areas (neither strong nor weak) and try to convert these areas into strong ones.\nMake sure you also work on areas for which you have conceptual clarity but take a lot of time solve. By studying these areas and reducing time spent on questions for these topics, you can most definitely gain in your preparation.\n2. Appear for mocks in your slots\nAll of you would know your CAT slot by now. You should now start appearing for Mocks in your CAT slot. This way, you will be mentally ready for the exam and would have developed the habit of staying sharp in the exact hours of the day you need to be at your best.\nAlso, practice two to three mocks per week at this stage. Do not over-do mocks: these are only to help you develop test-taking abilities and nothing else. Remember, no-one is going to ask your mock scores next year. The only score that matters is your CAT scores.\n3. Topic-wise preparation Schedule\nNow that we have covered the general information and insights above, it is time for me share some specific things that you need to commit to over the next few days:\nPractice 3 Reading Comprehension passages a day.\nSolve 10-15 questions (cumulatively) daily for the following topics: para-jumbles, misfit sentence, paragraph summary, and critical reasoning.\nRead 3 to 5 articles every day (you cannot ignore reading at any cost).\nSolve 2 Logical Reasoning sets a day.\nSolve 2 Data Interpretation sets a day.\nRevise concepts for one Quantitative Ability topic a day.\nSolve 20-25 questions (cumulatively) daily for the following topics: Geometry / Algebra / Arithmetic/ Number System / Modern Math (20 questions in total).\nTake 2 to 3 mocks', 'So to start preparing for CAT 2017 you can join WhatStudy, get 24*7 guidance by the current students of IIMs, FMS, MDI, JBIMS, XLRI, NMIMS, IIFT, SiBM P, SCMHRD, IITs and other top notch colleges.\nWhatStudy will help the aspirants with:\n- 24*7 Guidance by the current Top B schools students\n- Weekly Doubt Clearing Sessions\n- Mock Exams on all Entrances\n- Soft Copy Materials on Aptitude, LRDI, Vocab, DI.\n- Material on GK and Current Affair as well\n- WAT(Written Ability Test) practices\n- GDPI assistance\n- Mock PI Calls (By the respective mentors)\n- Resume building\n- SOP guidance\nWe will guide in every possible way to convert the best B School that you truly deserve.

There is a sectional time limit of 70 minutes which is maintained by an on-screen timer.\nA CAT aspirant therefore cannot choose the preferred section to solve first. Also, once the candidate is done with the first section, he/she cannot go back to it. With just a week away from taking up the exam, the aspirants might be little nervous regarding their CAT preparation. Here is some quick analysis on things to keep in mind before the final countdown begins.\nFOCUS\nThe aggressive time limit is what raises the overall difficulty level of the CAT exam. The questions are such that they can be solved by even a 10th grader. It’s the time management required to solve maximum questions correctly in the given time (speed and accuracy) that makes it so difficult.\nCandidates are supposed to attempt the Quant and DI section first. So even if LR or/and Verbal Ability are your strong sections, you can’t begin your test solving these. You therefore need to build up your knowledge on Quant and DI because:\nYou have to meet the sectional cut off.\nYou have to get a decent overall score\nYou have to give a positive start to your test.\nSectional time-limit is a now major turn-off for some CAT aspirants. So make sure to devise a proper plan where-in you put an equal emphasis on both the sections.\nANALYSE\nWith only one week left for CAT, you ought to analyse 2 major things:\nAreas of perfection and weakness.\nSpeed and accuracy.\nWhich are your areas of ease?\n- In which section are you more likely to score better?\n- What type of questions you are normally able to solve?\nWhat are your weak areas?\n- Which questions are most unlikely to be solved by you?\n- Which sections are more likely to take too much of your time and effort?\nMock tests will help you in making an in-depth analysis of both of the above mentioned parameters thereby assisting you in CAT preparation. The more you practice, the more you come across your stronger areas and the areas you need to work on. Final week won’t be a good time to build up totally new skills. You must therefore emphasize on sections you’re better at, so that you could manage to solve maximum number of questions in those sections.\nPLAN\nCAT is all about managing time. You got to plan on how to manage time such that you don’t spend too much of time solving a question.\nThis could be a major obstacle in clearing the sectional cut-off. By being well aware of your strong areas, you can devote time to each section accordingly and wisely. Like it’s generally advised to avoid spending more than 2.5 minutes on any question. But again, it varies with a person’s skills and abilities. Not everyone can solve every question in a span of 2.5 minutes. Here are some points you need to focus on:\nTake online mock tests\nThis will help you simulate the computer based format of taking the test and help you to keep up with an on-screen timer. However, usually mock tests tend to more difficult than the actual exam, so don’t get discouraged if you don’t find your performance up to your expectations. Just strive to do better each time than the previous one.\nPerform a quick scan before you attempt the test (not more than 2-5 mins)\nAn example could be clicking on a question in verbal section to find the number of Reading Comprehension passages.\nBe careful about clearing the sectional cut-offs\nIf you’re weak at Logical Reasoning, you can prepare and do well in Verbal Ability, to clear the sectional cut-off for the combined LR and Verbal section.\nConcepts Remain the Same\nDon’t forget to solve and examine the previous year’s question papers. You are not likely to find any repeated questions but you might be able to get a fair idea of what the questions actually looks like and what is being tested.\nSpeed is vital\nYou ought to increase your speed for both “reading”, “analyzing” and “solving” the questions. The faster you read and analyse a question, the quicker you solve it. Also, don’t spend too much time on one single question. If you find yourself getting stuck, move on to the next question. The good part about sectional time limits is that someone else has already done some time management for you.\nFind the Sitters\nBoth the sections will have some very easy questions which are termed as ‘Sitters’. Try to locate such questions while scanning the paper initially.\nWatch out for Speed Bumps\nWhile you’ll have the sitters to help you, there are often many speed bump questions which could end up taking all of your time to get solved.\nDon’t ignore the OMR sheet\nMake sure you keep marking the bubbles in the OMR sheet periodically. Filling up the OMR sheet at the end could be a potential risk and might make you fill up the wrong answers. There have been cases of students who solved the entire paper but still failed to clear CAT since they didn’t fill up the OMR sheet till the end!\nQuick Tip: The Elimination Rule\n“Elimination Rule” is a much discussed rule during the CAT Preparation:\nSometimes, the options given in a question are such that you might not even need to solve it. You can simply eliminate any option through simple logic and common sense. This could potentially avoid any wastage of time.\nKeeping the above mentioned points in mind will help you significantly. Remember that you can’t get back the time you have wasted until now. You only have to focus on how to utilize the available time in the best possible way.\nBe patient and keep working on your goal.

If one is motivated enough, one can easily cross the 80-90 percentile barrier depending on their clarity of concepts.\nThe coaching institutes will only benefit a person, if one is willing to put in the labour.\nNow coming to the institutes, TIME and CL have been in the game for too long and they have batches starting almost every week. They also have a number of teachers teaching the same subjects, so you cannot really experience which faculty is the best. Then TIME also has elite batches wherein only students from top colleges are admitted. Generally, the 100 percentilers are from the elite batches.\nThen there are the new entrants like Tathagat and MBAguru. From what I have heard is that Tathagat’s English faculty is better. Both of these institutes understand that quora is a medium people want their answers from and as a result they have their people writing praise for themselves on quora.\nSimply put, these institutes are out there to your money which amount to around ₹45–50k. They have receptionists calling themselves as counsellors who would probably influence your minds so as to believe that theirs is the best institute out there.\nMost of the people joining these institutes are people who are directionless after having finished their graduation and think that MBA would bring prosperity in their lives.\nTo summarise it, if you are motivated enough and are willing to put in the labour, you can study yourselves and then later enrol for their mock tests.\nHowever, if you are directionless and just want to get an MBA, join either of these institutes. There's going to be no spoon feeding even after you pay a hefty sum. The teachers would continue to teach at their pace so as to cover all the topics before your exams notwithstanding whether or not you are able to understand things in class.\nI don't know if I could help with this answer.

Irrespective of either you join in Jan/Feb or June, they shall reach the post by CAT time only. They never work out strategies to get the course done by stipulated timelines.\nLack of Management - You wont have ID cards till their test series, no intimation for abrupt change in the class timing, mode of communication is FB - severest flaw that they have.\nThey claim back ups, sure you shall get but it till July only.

My Phone was flooded by calls from all the BRANDS and standard names CAREER LAUNCHER, TIME etc. I was so damn confused as someone was offering scholarships, some were sharing their past success records wherever possible (Mails, on Call, Messages , Whatsapp etc.)\nSuddenly one day my cousin called up and said bro why don’t you try that institute on Barakhamba road , he dint know the name of institute , all he arranged for me is a number of his friend who attended the institute and an adjective for the faculty (Wahan pe English ke Choti wale sir hain bhai bahut faadpadhate hain ) .\nThis is all I knew about Tathagat until I went to the place and learnt more about totalgadha group and of course all the faculties.\nI planned to join the institute just on the basis of this word to mouth publicity and marketing being done by the students of TATHAGAT and then somebody just came to me and said “bhai dande se padhna hai to TathaGat join krle or agar khud hi bahut ache se padhai kr skta hai to koi bhi institute kyun join krna hai” and I realized the kind of person I am ( as I lack concentration , not very disciplined in my study schedules , a large social circle etc.) this institute can actually make me study either by choice or by force.\nNext weekend onwards I was a TGITE, from the very first day I could see the fear psychosis of not being allowed to attend the sessions with incomplete work started working for me, I never read any books and novels but yes KUMAR SIR (the so called English wale sir) made everybody read at least one novel/book a week. Even I used to finish my weekly tasks, which helped me to be in touch with the syllabus everyday rather than just attending a weekly session and then books closed till next session.\nNow the preparation was not maths and English , infcat it was broken into modules which are actually needed to be learnt and practiced (Quant , RC, SC ) . In my case I have this childhood fear with mathematics , I have never been able to score in mathematics , but here I actually improved on my question tackling techniques rather than mathematics , I won’t say my maths improved miraculously or anything superlative rather I just learnt to handle many problems of mathematics by simple logic rather than formulas and calculations.\nSessions with KUMAR Sir were most absorbing , those sessions were not just about SC or RC or a particular topic rather the sessions were a pool of abundant knowledge share and transfer, he used to talk about history , biology , music , science and almost everything , those sessions could be never ending if one actually wants to sit and listen. In the later part of the sessions TG used to organize practice and revision workshops and trust me those workshops are more than worth , this is the platform that even if you have not given your 100% and you feel your preparation is not upto the mark , these workshops are just wonderful you can cover up the whole Course and practice everything just double up your efforts during these workshops and you will be through.\nFor those looking forward for joining an MBA preparation Institute I would suggest Tathagat will give you a real and honest platform where you can learn and improve upon your aptitude and overall personality which you may or may not learn in your graduation school.', 'Hi mate ! I am here on quora just to help students like you who are stuck in the same dilemma. :p\nAs a student i think Tathagat is the best, i have many friends who have made their way to IIM’s . Just because of TATHAGAT\nYou have many options to choose from but all of them are not good enough, as per my knowledge, till now TATHAGAT is best in New Delhi, Located in the centre of Delhi i.e. Connaught Place.\nI know paragraphs are boring. so have a quick look at these points:\nTathagat follows an excellent pedagogy and they have the best teachers in Delhi. (yes they have! )\nThey have strict rules and regulations. You have to complete a novel within 7 days otherwise you will not be allowed to take verbal class. (i think this is the best way to keep yourself in discipline and crack IIM’s)\nApart from it, teachers are excellent and will help you out right from the beginning till your GD-PI sessions.\nKamal sir, Kumar sir, Gautam sir are just sufficient to not only make you prepare well for CAT but also make you a great individual. Sanjeev Sir(founder of Totalgadha and Tathagat) is all time high scorer in CAT and even scored 780 in GMAT. (Kumar sir!!! , my fav. )\nYou will not forget your journey of preparation throughout your lifetime.\nRight after joining TG you will be in love with reading novels and newspaper(Mainly The Hindu) within a month.\nThey have a library where you can find huge number of books that are recommended by them.\nTG also provides a 15 day trial period during which if you do not want to continue, they will return your complete fee.\nOn the contrary, TIME on the other hand do not provide any any trial period and they have large number of students in their batches. Teachers are not able to concentrate on each and every student. They just need fees and then it’s up to you if you study or not whereas in Tathagat they will make you study with their much stricter rules.\nAlso they have a program , where if you get the reference of a Tathagat student, you get Rs. 3000 discount on total fees… so if you want to use my reference, Just Mail At : grovershubham01@gmail.com']"
Is it possible that some student scores less percentile in the CAT but above the 96th percentile in the XAT and make it to XLRI?,4 Answers,['Xavier School of Management\nXavier Aptitude Test\nPercentile\nCAT Preparation\nCommon Admission Test (CAT)\nExams and Tests\nIs it possible that some student scores less percentile in the CAT but above the 96th percentile in the XAT and make it to XLRI?'],"['I can give an answer to that as I went through this scenario albeit 13 years ago. I am a 2008 batch graduate from XLRI Jamshedpur and I majored in HR (read PMIR during those times).\nI scored a 93%ile in CAT in 2005 and as expected did not get a call from any of the IIMs. Though dejected, I just put my head down and worked in the intervening month and a half to focus on XAT and FMS. The setback did work in my favour and I did clear all the MBA exams post that.\nMy XAT was 97%ile. Got calls from all the Colleges I had applied to. Cleared all, joined XLRI and the rest is history. What worked in my favour:\nSetback from CAT and the added focus on XAT (though XAT quant was much tougher and I believe that challenge is what separates chaff from the grain)\nI was the only one in my Batch with a Defense background. I was a Trainee Pilot with Indian Air Force, a graduate from the prestigious NDA Khadakvasla and RIMC Dehradun. My education and profile is what stood me apart from everyone else\nI was working as Quant, DI & LR and Personality Development faculty with PT Education in my hometown. This part-time work helped me prepare and used to keep me on toes every time lest some student was to ask a tough question\nLastly, I turned adversity to my benefit. Though I will never know what it could have meant to be in an IIM but I did enjoy my two years at XLRI. And I couldn’t have asked for more :)\nSo, yes you can make it to XLRI or for that matter any top B-School with your hard work, smartness and a bit of luck. Hope I did answer your query.\nGood luck!', ""Yes, it is possible and many of my friends have did this. BUT, read below with concentration as these things are very important\nTwo things here\nYes. It is indeed possible to score less percentile in CAT and above 96th percentile in the XAT and even make it to XLRI\nXLRI is not a piece of cake that you just score high in XAT and XLRI will be yours (yes, I am contradicting the past answer to the question)\nReasons\nThere are several reason for which you can score higher in XAT than CAT\nYou have given CAT and you have already a nice knowledge of Quant, verbal and reasoning and so in these 45 days you can prepare more.\nCAT is just an exam as all others which try to test everything in 3 hours. There could be many reasons like anxiety, health, silly mistakes or many others because of which you couldn't get through it but you could get those right in XAT.\nXLRI is not a piece of cake.\nXLRI is one of the oldest and top institutes in India. Even if you get 96%ile, you will be going through a tough interview and GD/WAT process and will be competing among nicest mind in country\nProfessors also understand that XAT is only a exam and so tests you on many perspectives along with your profile in considering you for the batch.\nA very inportant Caveat Here: Actually, most of people tend to get low %ile in XAT than CAT because of the reason that you get 45 days. Yes you heard it's right. Because you get more 45 days. Reason is that most of us tend to procastinate, loose our momentum which we had for CAT and end up scoring less.\nSo, study hard, do not take XAT light, and aim high. You could definitely get XLRI with some smart work.\nStudy"", 'Yes, absolutely.\nIt could happen that on the day of the exam there was something not right with that particular student.

How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,100+ Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I plan my preparation for the GRE?'],"['GRE has three main components namely verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing. Your entire preparation process should revolve around acquiring good skills on these areas and mastering the concepts required.\nSome of the things which you can do to get the required concept clarity are\nQuantitative reasoning:\nThe best part about GRE Math is the absence of things which most of us hate in Math - The integral calculus, trigonometry and other complicated stuff. GRE Math is mostly things which you learned in junior/ high school - Things like interger properties, word problems (rate of work, speed, probability etc) which can be solved with basic common sense. Not much beyond that.\nWhat makes the GRE so tricky is the interpretation of the questions part. Once you figure out what the question is asking, the math involved is definitely easier than what you faced in your high school. In fact, it is more fun as you don\'t need to write down each and every step and show your teacher on how you arrived at your answer. You just need to pick an answer. In short, the math section just tests your ability to reason with numbers.\nVerbal reasoning:\nVerbal reasoning section is even more simple with there being only 3 question types - text completion, critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The preparation process should be fully focused on knowing specific strategies for cracking these questions rather than generic preparation advocated.\nFor example, use of flash cards for learning new words was very helpful in the earlier format of the test where antonyms and analogies were asked and there was more emphasis on rote learning of words. But, the current format focuses more on understanding not only the literal meaning of the words but also the metaphorical use of the word based on the context. For example, while the word \'opaque\' literally means \'not transparent\', it could also mean \'difficult to interpret or understand\' if used in the right context. Similarly, there are no questions asking you to identify any grammar errors. Grammar is important only for your essay writing section. Hence, it makes sense not to rely on these old fashioned methods advocated by coaching institutes but to just keep focusing on the 3 question types.\nAnalytical writing:\nAnalytical writing section asks you to write 2 essays - one on ""The Issue"" and the other on ""The Argument"". The major difference here is in the first essay you are asked to take a stand on a complex issue whereas in the second essay you are asked to dissect the logic behind an already taken stand or position.\nHow do I prepare for this? You just need to follow a simple routine and you are guaranteed to score well in this section.\nChoose - Structure - Write - Compare - Improve - Choose\nStep 1: You choose a topic where you already have some well written sample essays. You can pick these up either in the official site or from the many blogs available online.\nStep 2: Come up with a structure and an outline.\nStep 3: Write an essay by developing the structure and the outline.\nStep 4: Compare it with other essays written on the topic.\nStep 5: Rewrite your essay to improve it.\nStep 6: Go to Step 1.\n--------------------\nIf you do all of the above, you are going to definitely score well on your GRE.\nCheck out Magnus Prep\'s GRE Program if you are looking for some great mentors to help with your GRE preparation.\nCheers!', 'When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.\n\nNote: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.\n\n1. First Month: Conditioning\nAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don\'t have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nWork out (don\'t just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.\nIn parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well)\n\nFourth Week:\nTime for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don\'t forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)\nMeanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.\n\nSo, it\'s been one month now. Don\'t expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.\n\n2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull\'s Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way\nNow it\'s time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don\'t think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I\'m going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nSign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It\'s a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.\nJoin the New GRE group on Facebook. It\'s the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:\nMembers post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.\nSecondly, it\'s a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation.\nYou\'ll get access to some really USEFUL links.\nThe next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.\nThe last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don\'t forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.\nNow you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it\'s time for some real action !!\nFourth Week\nTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that\'s all its useful for. Don\'t expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms\n\n3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racer\n\nFirst Two Weeks\nPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don\'t leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don\'t, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn\'t take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I\'m telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.\n\nLast Two Weeks\nIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I\'d read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:\n\n20 online tests\n\n800Score\'s Free Full Length Revised GRE Test\n\nMyGRETutor\'s 4 free Full Length Tests\n\nKaplan\'s Free Practice Test Options for the GRE\n\nPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length test\n\nIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!\n\nOriginally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?', 'Quant - 170 Verbal- 164 AWA- 4.5/6\nI recently gave my GRE on 28th September 2017. Although I started my preparation 3 months prior to the examination I could not continue due to the fact that I am also preparing for other competitive exams. Also I was put down by Chicken pox and Typhoid for a month. Effectively I had little more than a month to prepare for the test. So I was quite surprised with the result that I got as you can see above. Here is how I prepared for my GRE test.\nStudy Material -\nMagoosh GRE prep account (most important)\nMagoosh Vocabulary builder (words flashcard app)\nManhattan prep GRE 5 lb. book of gre practice problems\nManhattan GRE Prep Reading comprehension and Essay\nOfficial Guide for GRE by ETS (all three books)\nVarious news sites such as The New Yorker , The Economist etc. ( as prescribed on Magoosh GRE blog).\nStudy Plan -\nI started my preparation at the start of the month of July . As I told earlier I am also studying for other competitive exams so I could’nt devote much time to GRE. I studied for maximum 3 hours each day. I also did’nt study according to any plan. Some days it was only vocab building by flashcards and reading articles. Some days it was practicing problems Some days divided between both. Also I watched Magoosh GRE video lessons and I can say they were very useful.\nThis is a tip for students from engineering background preparing for GRE. Don’t ignore the quantitative section even if it seems easy to you. Practice it as you would the verbal section.\nAfter recovering from my maladies I had approx 5 weeks to prepare for GRE. So I decided to tidy up my routine so\nI increased my GRE study time to 5–6 hours per day\nIn a day I would first go through my magoosh flashcards and try to learn atleast 30 new words per day and also revise a few old words. Also I made a point to read and understand atleast 2 news articles per day .\nThen I would practice quantitative for approx 1 hour . I generally used timed custom practice test in Magoosh GRE account.\nFor next 2 hours I would go through practicing the verbal section and writing essays.\nI learnt how to read the paragraphs swiftly and in detail. Again Magoosh video lessons were very important in this regard.\nUnfortunately I was not able to give any full practice test due to my surroundings but I would recommend everyone to give atleast one of them.\nMy main focus was on improving my vocab by learning new words , their meaning and context of their uses as it appeared to me to be very useful for Sentence equivalence and Text completion questions. Again and I cannot stress this enough watching Magoosh video lessons was very important.\nI practiced and practiced as much as my schedule allowed me to.\nOn the day of the examination\nReach the centre atleast 1 hour prior to the commencement of test as there are plenty of verification to be done before the examination. Also carry a water bottle with you. GRE is very attentively conducted examination and staff of testing centres are very vigilant. If you have any problem feel free to ask for their help.\nGRE is a very easy exam as you can see in my case , with a directed and concentrated approach you can score very well ( 330+) within a relatively short amount of prep time.\nBe well , Be prepared and best of luck.', 'I’ve been tutoring the GRE for a number of years. The below is inspired by the many sessions I’ve had with students, many of whom have gone on to do very well on the GRE. A lot of it is also specific to the revised GRE, which made its debut in August 2011.\n \n1. Use official material\n \nWhen preparing for the GRE, no questions prepare you better than the ones written by ETS, which is responsible for writing the questions you will see test day. As much as possible, stick to the questions in the Official Guide to the GRE so you can wrap your mind around how the test writers want you to reason.\n \nYou may not think that it makes that much of a difference, but many publishers out there have questions that require you to make certain leaps of logic—or employ questionable logic—that you will never have to do on the actual test. Then there is the fact that many questions simply aren’t as difficult or nuanced as the questions you’ll see test day. This is a problem many students encounter when using Kaplan—you are essentially taking a dumbed down version of the GRE, with often poorly constructed questions to boot.\n \n\n2. Take practice tests\n \nThere is no better way to prepare for test day than actually taking a mock test. You will train yourself to sit for three plus hours staring at a screen, as you are pummeled by an onslaught of GRE problems.\n \nIf possible, use only the official tests, found in the Official Guide to the New GRE. There are four such tests—two that comes with the book, and two that are computer-based and come with the CD that is part of the book. Stagger these out  over the four weeks you are prepping, so that there are no fewer than five days between tests and no more than ten days. If you are studying longer, you might also want to consider Manhattan GRE tests (see below).\n \nFinally, practice tests will allow you to better assess your strengths and weaknesses, and help inform your study sessions in between tests.\n \n \n3. Focus on weaknesses\n \nMake sure not to get carried away developing those areas in which you already excel. For instance, if you are generally strong at math problem solving questions, but if you dislike Data Interpretation (that’s the section with all the graphs), then the last thing you want to do is avoid that section. Instead make it a priority to become confident and effective at all questions relating to Data Interpretation.\n \n \n4. Use the best material\n \nWhile official material is clearly the best prep out there, it doesn’t necessarily provide the most effective strategies. You may want to take a look at Princeton Review for helpful big picture strategies. As for specific strategies for almost every aspect of the GRE—from permutations to convoluted paragraph arguments—the Manhattan GRE books (MGRE) are the best. MGRE also has six practice tests that mimic the actual test very well (though this more so with math than with verbal). For more practice on the online format, Magoosh also offers questions that are similar to--and often more difficult--than those found on the actual test. (I should probably mention that I work for Magoosh :))\n \nOf course there is a lot of material out there that should be avoided, especially in terms of practice content.

Here’s a glimpse at some of the top Canadian universities that accept GRE scores, and their respective GRE requirements:\nDownload the ebook GRE Cutoff Scores for Top 35 Universities\nTOEFL/IELTS score: Both the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) are accepted at universities in Canada, Germany and the US, and seek to assess your command and fluency over the English language.

Given the fact that a student’s CGPA does not completely reflect the student’s potential but to a certain extent about the faculty, college & competition in the university, it’s seen as a relative criterion. To explain in simple words, your GPA is considered as good or bad depending on your topper’s GPA.

Because universities abroad typically receive hundreds of applications with similar credentials, your SOP is your one chance to showcase your individuality and your dreams and aspirations, and set yourself apart from your peers. The SOP is commonly thought to be a replacement for the personal interview, and for that reason, it is crucial that you nail it just right. For the lowdown on how to craft the perfect winning SOP, make sure you checkout our top tips and tricks!\n\nDownload ebook: How To Craft A Winning SOP >>\nLetters of Recommendation: Written by former professors or employers, the LOR is an important testament to your intellectual and personal character, and is essentially a promise from one professor to another that you are an intelligent, diligent student, and deserving of an admit. Ideally, you should get LORs from professors who have supervised your thesis or research project, Heads of Departments, or from professors who have taught you and known you for a substantial period of time, especially if they are well-known in their field and have published extensively. You can also submit LORs from employers, although it is recommended you only do this if you’ve been out of college for a few years.\nWork and research experience: As a fresh undergraduate, you aren’t typically expected to have work experience apart from the usual internship or voluntary work. However, if you do have such experience, make sure to highlight it in your CV and SOP. Most applicants tend to apply to graduate school straight after finishing undergrad, and view work experience as a filler, but work experience not only allows you to gain a fresh perspective on the world, but also facilitates the development of new, life-defining skills, and the ability to work in and lead diverse groups of people, all of which are paramount to graduate applications. As far as research is concerned, do remember, universities in the US are vastly different from Indian ones, especially because of the onus they place on research and development, to the extent where applicants with a relatively lower GPA have won admits to top schools based purely on their excellent research experience in the past. If you have substantial research experience, it would be a good idea to get your research supervisors to write you a reference letter, and also issue you any relevant certificates. Both research and work experience are especially beneficial in making up for any shortfalls in you GPA or GRE scores, and also in getting scholarships and other aid.\nWhat are the common mistakes students make while applying?\nTime, as they say, is money, and this is especially true for MS applications, where every single day is of prime importance. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that you plan your application well in advance and follow a proper timeline so that you don’t find yourself floundering for time. So what are some of the mistakes that trip up study abroad aspirants? Let’s take a look:\nStarting GRE preparation late: Your GRE, as we mentioned, is one of the most important building blocks of your application, so ideally, you must give yourself sufficient time to start preparing for the test, so you can identify your weak points and work on them properly. You also need to have enough time so that if you find your GRE scores unsatisfactory, you can choose to rewrite it.\nInability to shortlist universities: Of course, Harvard, MIT and Caltech are the dream of millions, but realistically, is your profile compatible with the stringent requirements of these universities? Before applying, draw up a list of 8-10 universities you would like to attend, based on criteria such as GRE requirements, tuition fee, acceptance rate, past admits, alum profiles, cultural & research field compatibility with faculty etc.\n\nRemember, you will be spending quite a bit on application fees, so make sure you don’t waste time and money on schools that are unrealistically out of your league.\nDownload The SELECT Strategy to Shortlist Universities eBOOK here\nLacking the relevant details about deadlines and requirements: Universities in the US and Canada are extremely strict about the application deadlines: for instance, for fall admit, applications usually close in the first week of December of the previous year. Many aspirants often fail to take cognizance of deadlines, or neglect to send in their applications keeping in mind the time it would take to reach the US. A good idea is to note down the application deadlines of the various programs you want to apply to, well in advance. Do remember that if you are applying for a scholarship, deadlines are typically earlier. Additionally, many schools have an early bird round, which closes much before the usual deadlines. Applying in an early bird round greatly improves your chances at an offer letter, so if you’re ready, you can send in your applications right in time for that!\nConsulting unofficial/inaccurate/random websites: The internet is a quagmire of information, and it is easy to fall into a trap of misinformation if you are not careful. While researching for application information, be sure to stick to only the university’s official websites. If you are still doubtful or have any questions, be sure to write to the admissions help desk of the university to be sure.\nSending an incomplete or inadequate application: Applying overseas is not as straightforward as applying to universities in India: there is a lot more paperwork involved, such as healthcare insurance, transcripts, and visas, and in order to prevent your application from being summarily rejected, you need to ensure that your application package is complete.\n\nOverwhelmed?\nDon’t worry. Please find the MS application checklist right below to help you plan your entire application process.\nDownload the eBOOK “MS Admit: The Application Checklist” here\nWe hope you found this information useful, and now have some clarity on the various building blocks to ensuring an offer letter to your dream university.

We wish you all the best on your journey forward!', 'Dear GRE aspirant,\nDo you think that modest GRE scores and backlogs would hold back a profile? No, definitely not.\nTo help you in understanding this claim better, I have a chart* with three GREedge alumni with modest GRE scores and backlogs.\n*Data obtained from GREedge’s Admission Counselling Team\nSo, these profiles are indeed testimony to the fact that apart from your GRE score, a host of other factors determine the status of your admits.\n\nNow that you know this, I’m sure you are wondering what these factors are. Based on my experience as the Co-founder of GREedge, I would like to share them with you.\n\nBefore you get to these factors, you must know the application process to know how universities shortlist candidates. This would give you a background of what universities look for in a prospective candidate.\nA general flow of the application process would look like this:\nOver the evaluation process, Universities, in general, look to scrutinize you on a holistic basis.The evaluation begins by examining your CGPA and a host of other factors. Some of these factors include the scores of your admission requirement tests, Letter of Recommendation, Statement of Purpose/essay among the rest. So, clearly understand what universities use as a sieve in screening your application.\nMost universities have some common filters. Some of them include:\nCompetitive GPA: Once your application package reaches the university, it is immediately forwarded to the Graduate Department. The first scrutiny that is made on the application is the “test of your GPA”. Your GPA speaks volumes about your application. If you are a rank-holder or if you have a consistent academic track record, then you can definitely expect some weightage. Countries like the U.S. and Germany place a huge emphasis on GPAs. For example, Georgia Tech requires an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better to pursue a Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (MS-HCI). Though you cannot completely balance your profile with high GPA, a consistent and competitive GPA will definitely add substantial value to your profile. In addition to your GPA, the following academic factors will give your application an edge too.\nTOEFL/IELTS: A great deal of emphasis is placed on your IELTS or TOEFL score apart from your GRE score. Most universities require a good TOEFL or IELTS score. For example, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, requires a minimum of 90 points in the Internet-based TOEFL (iBT). Georgia Tech, on the other hand, for the MS-HCI program, requires a minimum of 100 in TOEFL. Universities emphasize on TOEFL/IELTS scores to determine the status of TA/RA. Further, IELTS and TOEFL scores are also taken into account in determining the quantum of your scholarships and fellowships. Keep it a point to research on the minimum requirements. A TOEFL score over 100 or IELTS score over 7 will indeed add value to your profile.\nLetter of Recommendation: The basic purpose of the Letter of Recommendation is to get a person to vouch for your credentials. This, no doubt, adds value to your profile. Ensure that you get two or three Letters of Recommendation. The Letter of Recommendation must come from someone who has been associated with you. It can be your university professor or your senior at workplace. Further, it will also add value if the person who recommends you has a PhD. So, make it a point to get a commendable Letter of Recommendation and this will indeed boost the value of your profile.\nStatement of Purpose: Your SOP is just like your personal interview with the Admission Committee. Convey all that you want the Admission Committee to know about your profile.Your Statement of Purpose must be genuine and convincing. Make it a point to highlight the drive behind your Master’s program. Answer all possible questions, such as:\n\n1. Your degree of interest in your chosen field\n2. What made you apply for the particular university\n3. Why did you choose the particular course\n\nEnsure that you don’t leave out any relevant information. Make it a point to highlight all your academic achievements and professional goals. Always remember that your SOP is as good as an interview. So, draft a compelling SOP that would persuade the Admission Committee to consider your profile.\nYou can keep the following guidelines in your mind while you draft your SOP:\nPaper Publication and Research Work: Having a good number of paper publications and research work will show that you had been in touch with the academic community. Ensure that you have your papers published in international journals. Also, if you had participated in international conferences, ensure that you highlight them. A good number of paper publications and research work will indeed add points to your applications. So, even if you have not published any papers until now, get started with it. Paper publications and research work add a high impact to your profile.\nWork Experience: Work experience will be a crucial factor in adding value to your profile. Two or three years of relevant experience will add precious points to your profile. Further, it will also be a good source for your Letter of Recommendation. Though work experience is not a mandatory requirement, relevant work experience in a reputed company will add value.\nProject and Internships: Your project and internships will definitely be considered while your application is evaluated. The degree of your practical knowledge and research acumen can be demonstrated through projects and internships. So, highlight your projects and internships. Make it a point to highlight your projects and internships in an appropriate manner.\nApart from these factors, you can certainly highlight your co-curricular and extracurricular activities too. They will also be considered since they throw light on your overall personality.Though there is no set order of priority in evaluating a candidate’s profile, you can indeed make a huge impact if you can balance out your profile. So, have a balanced profile and try not to compromise on any element. Remember that universities look for candidates with a holistic profile and not someone with unilateral strength. This will indeed make all the difference.\nAll the best!', 'Note: You can follow my Quora blog for more info about higher education abroad: https://studyabroadgre.quora.com/\nSOP Evaluation here: SOP Evaluation procedure by Mihir on Study Abroad\nPS: Before I answer anything else, I will directly answer the question asked by most of the applicants: Can my GRE compensate for poor GPA/CGPA? The answer is NO. Now read everything below:\nGRE is not a big selection criterion for MS programs.\nThe selection of a candidate for MS program is a 2 stage process:\nScreening process by the admin department: This screening process goes something like, there is a list of cut-off score or threshold values for certain selection criterion. For example, all students with GRE above 310 will be cleared, or all students with CGPA above 8.0/10.0 will be selected etc. This limit is not very strict and is flexible. TOEFL is one such criterion that will fall only and only in this screening process and not evaluated for the next one, unless you are going for TA/RA, in which case they need to evaluate your English language capability (still it will be least importance).\nSelection process by Adcom: In this process, you will be judged on your GPA, GRE score, SOP, LOR etc and is highly flexible. A student with great acads but not so good GRE can be selected over a student with perfect GRE score and average acads. It depends on your whole application file BUT certain parameters weigh more than the others.\nUsually the selection criterion goes like this (in descending order):\nAcademic GPA/CGPA/%age as well as ranking in your batch\nUndergrad university\nSOP\nResearch ex/Work ex\nGRE\nLOR\nThese other factors will vary from case to case:\nFinal Year Project\nInternship and papers\nCo/Extra-curricular\nProf Letting\nProblems people might face:\nBacklogs\nYear Gap\nPlagiarism\nSome people may disagree, but this is what I personally think, seen and experienced.\nSELECTION CRITERION:\n1. Acads are the most important parameters:\nYour GPA or %age is the prime deciding factor. If you are topper in your batch and have shown outstanding academic performance, the chances are that you will be a preferable candidate for the program. Backlogs will damage your admission chances drastically. Although you can still find cases with a lot of backlogs and people still get admission in the university. Read this link at the end of the answer those who have low confidence in this area (he had 55 backlogs; read the whole thread/story).\n2. Undergrad University:\nIf you belong to one of the top universities in your country, and you have descent acads, then you have good chances of admission. BEWARE, if you are from a top university BUT your acads are weak you will have a disadvantage compared to a student who is from a descent ranking university but high GPA. That\'s how it goes, \'Be on the top where ever you are\', that\'s something to be learned not just for MS admission process but for life as well. :D\n3. Statement of Purpose (SOP):\nI personally feel that SOP is a big deciding factor in your admission. You can be a lot of different by writing an excellent SOP. Your SOP will say a lot of thing about you silently that a strong profile will never be able to speak out. SOP tells your attitude, your ambition, your clarity of thought and your personality. These sometime overweight excellent profiles. This video will help you realize the importance of a good SOP (UMass Amherst Admission Committee):\nAlso if you want to read more about it, check the link at the end of the answer.\n4. Work/Research ex, GRE and LOR:\nI will prefer not to rank them in a strict order because they will depend on the type of program you are applying to. If you are applying for a research based program, your research/work ex and LOR will be of higher value than GRE, but if may be it is not a specifically research based MS program, then if is possible that GRE may matter more. A good GRE score will certainly help. Score above 310 is considered okay-okay.... may be descent... 320+ is desirable and good... 330+ is excellent. AWA also matters and 3.0+ is almost like mandatory... 4/4+ is good.\nWork/research ex is helpful not just during MS application process but also after completing your MS when job hunting. A relevant work ex is recommended and good, but if you have work ex in a different field than what you are going to study, no promises can be made if it will help.\nIf you are interested in doing some research work and gain some research experience before applying for MS you can apply as RA at IITs under a prof. Here are some details on that: http://www.edulix.com/forum/show...\nLORs are important mainly for PhD programs. they do add some weight to the application, but only if a prominent professor from a premier institute or a high ranking official from work place writes it. It is also important to send the LOR only using the official university/company mail id of the prof/boss, else although acceptable, they will add ZERO points to application.\nFinally I will add the uncertainty factor: LUCK. :D Although they say ""The harder I work, the luckier I get.""\nUpdate: To include all the rest of the factors involved in the admission process.\nTHESE FACTORS WILL VARY FROM CASE TO CASE:\n1. Final Year Project (FYP):\nCheck this too: Mihir Gupta\'s answer to Which kind of project should I do so that I can show it in my resume for MS in US?\nThis is also one of the important deciding factors for admission, especially for one applying for MS with thesis. It will demonstrate your ability to convert your theoretical know-how into practical engineering knowledge. Also if your project is good enough, you can get a paper out of it and publish it. Sometimes, if he admission process involves an interview with a prof who is willing to take you as RA/TA, then the FYP is very important as mos of the interview questions will be from the project.\n2. Internships and Papers:\nInternship that are usually undertaken by B.Tech students in 3rd or 4th year matter only if they project assigned to them is a good one and it they do it from a reputed firm like IISC, DRDO, or some big pvt companies. Here the important thing will also be to work for a longer time as one month\'s internship won\'t be of any use. If you work for a minimum 3 months and are also able to impress your boss such that he is willing to give you recommendation, that will be the best case scene. It is also possible to try score internships abroad in a university or a company. They are a big plus for overall profile.\nResearch papers published during the final year project or internship will help those who wish to go for MS with thesis option but not very much for students aiming for MS without thesis (MEngg; 1 yr course). The impact factor of the journal you have published your work in will be considered, but not much as adcom do not expect a high quality research work from an undergrad unless it is a direct PhD application.\n3. Co/Extra-curricular:\nThese activities will not offer you any major advantage, but will make your resume/CV look bright and show that you are involved in activities other than acads. If you do not have good acads and bad GRE, then these activities will be of zero importance, on the other hand if you profile is good and you have done some nice activities, then these will provide you an edge over student who has profile similar to yours.\n4. Prof-Letting:\nThis is useful only when you think you have good admission chances and that you want to work under a prof as RA/TA under a prof during MS. For this the credentials responsible will differ. Of course acads will still hold importance, but after that will come your work ex, research ex, papers, project and LOR. There is a method required to contact profs of the desired university. You can read all about it in the link at the end of the answer.\nPROBLEMS PEOPLE MIGHT FACE:\n1. Backlogs:\nDon\'t feel disappointed if you have had a few backlogs. Although your list of universities will be a bit different compared to the one who had no backlogs, but you still do have a good chance to succeed. For this I will again link you to this guy who had 55 backlogs and still got admit and visa as well. All you need is strong motivation, hard work and will power.\nBacklog in a core subject, the one you are selecting your specialization for MS will hurt bad, but if it is in an unrelated subject, it will probably not be that bad.\n2. Year Gap:\nIf you completed your UG in 2012 and did nothing till June 2013, then it will be called a year gap. If you worked for a major part of that year (6/6+ months) then its not probably not a year gap.\nSome year gaps are acceptable. Like you took a year off to work in an NGO or may be for (Teach For India) TFI or something like that, then it is acceptable.\nThe other case may be that you were preparing for GATE or any other exam. This will be a negative factor for your profile unless you did great in that exam and that exam somehow added to your profile (like good GATE score is valuable for German universities).\nThe third case can be that you were search for job and by the end you decided to take GRE for MS. This will have really bad effect on your profile, unless you can cover it with something valuable you might have done side by side.\n3. Plagiarism:\nThis is kind of an indirect factor that may affect your chances of admit, BUT if found guilty, you may not just receive reject from the university you applied to but also from other universities you are going to apply to. Plagiarism is a serious issue when it comes to higher studies. So my advice will be DO NOT try to copy anything.\nSo if you find my answers helpful, do endorse me for topics.\nLINKS (For any help use Edulix - Premier Site for Scholars - \'Education Crowd-Sourced\'.

PM me if you need help here.', 'TOEFL will not matter, but GRE does matter for an entry to a top MS program. More importantly, once you achieve something around 167 and above in quant and 160 and above in Verbal, even GRE does not matter. These days a lot of Indian students are applying with GRE scores of 325+, so I do not think GRE will pull you up, unless you get 335+ (but anything less than 315 will pull you down).\n\nWhat matters --\n1) CGPA (higher the CGPA better are your chances. Anything with 9 pointer above will be a good bet).\n\n2) Rank (if your university of college gives you a recognised rank then say your CGPA is 8, but still you are second in class, then it shall help your case).\n\n3) Name of the institute. Better recongized is your institute, better are your chances. For example: names such as IIT, NIT or BITS do hold value.\n\n4) Internships -- If you have internship at IIT or some other good US university, then you have brighter chances of achieving an admission. If you have internships at top multinationals (such as for CS guys microsoft, IBM labs, intel, samsung and so on) then also you can secure a good MS program. Your internship at a startup can also help you, if the work done is good.\n\nThe main point to understand is at the end of the day, work matters.\n\n5) If you have research papers or some academic awards or grants, then it will help you pass through a good MS program. Publishing researh papers does not mean that a person publishes 10 papers, but the conference or journal is not even recognized. Even if you have a single paper, but from a reputed organization, then it is far better than ten.\n\n6) Contacts with foreign univeristy profesor. If you have any interaction with the professor of the college of your choice, then you have an edge.\n\n7) SOP -- A golden rule, write the truth and not stories. State your achivements and your study plans, group to join and professor to work with.\n\n\nPS: Thanx to Nikhil Prabhu for edits']"
What are some tips to be followed to join MS course in US through GRE?,7 Answers,"[""Master of Science Degree Admissions and the Graduate Record Examination\nMaster's Programs and the Graduate Record Examination\nMaster's Programs in the United States of America\nHigher Education in the United States of America\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nMaster of Science Degrees\nMaster's Programs\nWhat are some tips to be followed to join MS course in US through GRE?""]","['In order to pursue MS in a particular course in the United States of America one must give the GRE and TOEFL. We need to understand that everyone dreams to pursue higher education in the US and hence our chances for admission in a top 20 university are really slim.\nGRE and TOEFL are not the only criteria under which we get admission into a good college. There are many more criteria’s under which the college authorities judge us. Education system in the US is very different from the education system in India, For example; they grade their student on a 4 point GPA scale and follow a relative grading system also they give very high priority to hand on job experience.\n To put into context I will enlist some of the must have qualities that you need to get into a Top 20 college in the US.\n \n 1. A good CGPA or percentage in your Undergraduate: As we all must know that the GRE does not have subject specific test and hence your CGPA is the only thing that reflects your knowledge in a particular subject. (This might be overlooked if you do your masters from your home country or you have been working after completing your graduate school)\n \n 2. High GRE score. A score of 325+ is required in order secure admission into a top college. Your GRE score reflects your aptitude and command on English knowledge that is very vital to survive in a cut throat competition.\n \n 3. High TOEFL score. A TOEFL score of 100+ is considered very decent, and can easily get you into a top 20 college in the US. Your TOEFL score might also get you fellowship and scholarship. (More info in provided in the coming sections).\n \n 4. Internship/Job Experience.\n \n If you are applying in a US university directly after your graduation then you must have decent amount of internship certificates. Recently I read a study in Economics Times regarding how Ivy league colleges are providing special acknowledgement to those who have had working experience in a start up (Does not matter if it was successful or not). I would suggest you to get as much internship as you can in MNC/NGO/Start-Up.\n \n If you have already passed out your graduate school and currently working then I would suggest you to get minimum of 2 years of experience. But if you have been working in a company for 7-8 years then your chances to get into these universities get a bit low, as with age people to tend to be rigid and are a bit difficult to train.\n \n 5. Recommendation letter and Statement of purpose: These are only viewed by the college you applied in once you have impressed them by your CV and academics.\n \n Many people tend to copy their SOP or get it written by someone else. It is very important to understand that all top universities have their interview rounds and they might ask you about your SOP, and it is better to write your SOP on your own rather than getting embarrassed in front of your professors. Writing your SOP is really easy, all you need to do is tell them why you want to join a particular university, trust me the more truthful you are the better it reflects to them.\n \n Moving onto the Letter of recommendation part, this is more like a certification from your seniors (At Workplace), Professors from your regular college and Professors from any summer/winter school you attended. I wouldn’t go into detail for this section as it is really easy to get a letter of recommendation in countries like India etc.\n \n Apart from the qualities mention above there are many more qualities you must have (But are secondary) in order to land your dream college. Some of those qualifications are,\n 1. Sports participation in inter college competition\n 2. Certification from a reputed institution in a musical instrument or vocals.\n etc\n \n \n I wouldn’t go into the details of every aspect of your application, but will surely try to provide useful insight to the important aspects\n \n Now it is really important for you to understand how to ace the GRE , for that lets look at the pattern of the examination.\nGRE consists of 2 sections ie\n \n1. Quantitative section deals with basic and general mathematics that we were taught in high school and it requires a strong conceptual knowledge in the subject.\n To master the quantative section you need to practice the basic mathematics i.e. Math’s of class 11 and 12. But in GRE only the basic conceptual application based problems are asked and I would suggest you to really get some help from a institute that provide proper GRE coaching/training. IF you have a good basics in mathematics then I suggest you to avoid going to any classes and simply buy a correspondence package from some reputed institute. The pattern of GMAT CAT and GRE is very different so please don’t try to practice from any book, Plan and work.\n \n 2. The verbal section involves grammar, reading comprehensions and vocabulary knowledge. Verbal section is very important for students applying for grants and fellowship in order to get funding for their education abroad. A high verbal score provides the university with a sense that yes the candidate has a decent command over the language and can be a useful resource to a professor.\n Mastering the verbal section though could be a really tough job as our first language is not English, But don’t worry I have the solution for you.\n Don’t just mug up the words, plan and work.\n \n \n Steps to learn new words in effective manner\n \n 1.Pickup reading material that excites you let it be newspaper, books, novels or whatever.\n 2. Mark the words that you find foreign and jot them down.\n 3. Try to identify the roots of the words.\n 4. Later try to find the meaning of these words on your own in terms of the context you read and literal meaning in dictionary.\n \n Now to learn the roots I would suggest you to refer to book by “Norman Lewis” called “Word power made easy”.\n But just learning the roots is not enough you need to learn its application and for that I suggest you to download the app VOLT – Vocabulary Learning Technique. And it is made by IIT and IIM alumni; the app has many great features that will help you.\n \n Some of them are,\n \n 1.Pictorial representation of the word ( In the sense it can be used ) explained correct meaning\n 2.Provision of synonym and antonyms of every word, its usage in sentence , pronunciation of the word in both verbal track and written (break down of the word) .\n 3. The app has numerous words which can be learnt and are used in our day to day lives.\n 4. If you are going to give your GRE exam in 2-3 months then this app is bible for you, as in less time you will be able to learn the most probable words that could be asked in you exam\n \n The App provides with pictures that represent the word. Visual representation leaves maximum impression on our brain and hence makes it very easy to learn new words.\n \n But the best usage of VoLT can only be taken if you practice the words regularly in your daily life and apply them as much as you can. Else it’s just mugging up words that will lead you nowhere.\n \n \n The above mentioned technique will not only help you in your GRE only but also will be an indispensible tool in preparation of your TOEFL exam. I have seen people prepare for their TOEFL in just 2 days and score 100+, but this is a very risky method to follow and is only suitable for people who have given their GRE as they have already worked on their English skills.\n \n Moving onto to the other aspects of your application, getting internship is a really vital part of it.\n Following are the ways you can get a good internship with good job profile\n \n 1. If you are a fresher then I would suggest you to download apps like Internshala, Linked in etc. These have posting from companies ranging from MNC’s to NGO to startups. Fresher’s are usually hired by startup companies in the field of marketing, content writing and sales. As you have already read how working at a Startup might help you I would definitely recommend you to apply in your winter and summer breaks.\n \n 2. If you are in your second year of graduation, I would recommend you to go to specific websites of the companies who are the market leaders in your study field and apply in the career section of these website. For example, in Economics; if you are in 2nd year I would recommend you to apply in companies like E&Y, Delloite etc. You would be surprised to know how active they are in providing internship in various fields. This will prove to be very helpful for you in the future even if you don’t pursue MS and just sit for placement from your college.\n \n 3. If you have already passed out from college then I would suggest you to go for job profile over salary. Always keep in mind the field of study in which you are going to apply for MS and what you currently are working on, else it will be very difficult to explain them in your SOP about how you developed interest in the field that you want to pursue and applying in.\n \n Your GRE score is valid for 5 years so don’t rush into things; Universities only want the cream of every field. Try to be best in the country and consider meeting a career counselor as they would provide you with tailor made lists of universities that you should apply in (According to you CV and profile)\nMake sure to check out our app VOLT on Google play store.

(Ex., summer internship at top colleges in India/abroad, robotics events, SAE SUPRA/ BAJA). (You will need this to get scholarship in safe universities and admission in ambitious university).\nAlso if you get certificate for any type community services (ex. teaching village kids, distributing food and clothes etc.) from some NGO then that will help a lot as well.\nKeep very good relations with faculties who are either have higher positions (ex. HOD) or with PHD degrees (from reputed colleges if possible). (This will help a lot while getting LORs from prof. Greater the reputation of faculty recommending you better the effect on admission.)\nStart preparing your SOP (Statement of purpose). Make sure to right your every important achievement and your thinking towards making world better. Also right about “Why this course?” to prove you are passionate about it. Google some SOPs and you will get the idea.\nGet three LORs (Letter of recommendation) from 3 different professors. Make sure to take LORs signed and stamped on college letter head and also make soft copies of all LORs before you seal them into college envelop(in most of the universities your respective professor will have to upload soft copies of signed and stamped LORs online.) (Generally people prepare 10 sets of LORs if they are planning to apply in 5-7 uni. to be on safer side).\nGet 10 original transcripts from your college in special envelop with your college symbol on it. Have original transcript scanned soft copy as well.\nGet 10 sets of all your college mark sheets, provisional degree/original degree true copied from your college registrar.\nGet 10 sets of 10th and 12th mark sheets true copied from your school principal.\nIn last year start preparing for GRE. If you are a student who comes in “above the average” category then you can prepare by yourself otherwise better to have classes to prepare for it. For this exam you need to be good in particularly 2 things - MATHS & ENGLISH. GRE fees - 195 $. GRE score is valid for 5 year but most of uni. consider max up to 2 years old score only so plan according to that.\nOnce you clear GRE then start preparing for TOEFL/IELTS exam. This exams are compulsory to prove your efficiency in ENGLISH in READING, SPEAKING, WRITING & LISTENING. Both exams has almost same course and pattern. Most of universities in USA accepts both scores (TOEFL/IELTS) but if you want to keep open a door for MS in CANADA as well then go for IELTS only. TOEFL fees- 170$, IELTS fees- 11,100 RS.\nOnce you got your GRE & TOEFL/IELTS scores in hand you can start shortlisting universities. People generally applies to 5–7 universities but there is no limit. Different universities have their own application fees. It can cost around 7000–10000 rs. to apply in 7 university. Some universities let you apply freely as well. Now the main question comes “how to shortlist universities?”. Well you can use YOCKET app, Stupid Sid website, edulix, experience of seniors, etc. Use scores, ranking, reputation, budget of fees, etc to short list universities.\nStart applying to universities, you can apply by yourself or you can choose a consultancy for it. But you have to be well researched and careful while applying by yourself. Many universities will ask financial documents, just to confirm that you can afford the fees. (These financial documents will be help full in VISA process as well.)\nAfter applying online its time to courier the true copied/ original documents to respective universities. Some uni. demands hard copies some don’t. Use edulix courier scheme(~825 rs /courier) or Stupidsid courier scheme (~900 rs/ courier). These are the cheapest and most reliable schemes available for courier. Google it and you will find a webpage for these schemes.\nWait for the decisions of universities. As soon as you start getting admission you will start getting I 20 form from respective universities(These I 20 documents are very important, don’t loose them).\nOnce you decide for university and you got I 20 for that uni. then you will have to take VISA appointment on suitable date by paying 160$. Before going for VISA interview you will have to pay SEVIS fees of 200$ as well.\nPrepare necessary documents and answers for general questions asked in Visa Interview. Go for the VISA interview. Once you get the VISA then book your flights ticket.\nYou can not go to USA earlier than 30 days of your college start date. Generally people go 15–20 days early. Sometimes it is wiser to book tickets even if your VISA interview is not done because ticket cancellation charges range from 5000–10000 rs. and price of tickets increase 6000–10000 every one or two weeks.\nthanks for the edit Apoorva Suresh\nEdit 2- I had added some points those I forgot to mention before.\nEdit 3- Some links of books and apps that are useful in preparation of GRE.\nGRE Magoosh , GRE Magoosh Flash Cards\nKaplan GRE\nBarrons GRE', 'Looking back I feel there were some things that if I had known before I would have taken some different decisions:\n1. If you get admission in a reputed but expensive college and you have partial scholarship or even no scholarship; I would say go for it. I know for someone coming from a middle class background and taking a huge loan doesn’t seem like a good idea ; but my point is once you get a job you can repay that amount in a year or so easily. Getting a degree from a good college matters a lot, because even your compensation will be more compared to someone graduating from an average college.\n2. When choosing courses take tough courses which will teach you a lot and not courses which will give you good grades but doesn’t add much to your knowledge. Remember these courses are expensive so make it worth your money. This might be difficult for some of us coming from Indian education system where we give more importance to grades than to education experience. You might get a lower grade but make sure to get your concepts right; you will understand the importance when you are giving interviews at big companies like Google, Microsoft etc.\n3. Work for at least a year after graduating from your Bachelors; it gives you crucial experience based on which you can make your future decisions. Many people find out that they were not meant for this technical field and it’s better to do something else, like MBA or MIS. Others will find out if they like a particular branch more than others and decide to do specialization (MS or PhD) in that area.\n4. MBA vs MS: Like I mentioned in the previous point, working after you graduate will help you in making this decision. If after working for a year you find that you enjoy working in technical field and you see yourself in this field in the next 5-10 years at least then go for MS. If you find out that you don’t like the technical field you are in and want to completely change the direction than go for MBA.', 'Thanks for A2A!\nWell, GRE isn’t the only factor considered by the admission committees and you need to have an overall good profile to get into top universities.\nLet me give you some tips for GRE,\nWrite as many mock tests as you can! GRE isn’t always about getting the answers right, it can be a strenuous exam wherein your brain has to be active through out the exam (3.5+ hours). In simple, Practice matters!\nMost people take the AWA part easily. I would suggest you to practice 4–5 essays before your actual test. Also, when you take your mock tests, don’t skip the AWA part! Remember, AWA can be tiring and can take a toll on the quants, verbal sections too without proper practice.\nMake use of Flash Cards for verbal, it helped me! With respect to quants, focus on your weak points and solve using a timer.\nWith respect to TOEFL, you can follow notefull videos and they should be pretty much helpful!\nApart from GRE, TOEFL focus on your GPA, Projects, Publications, Work exp if any, SOP, LORs etc at the time of applying. Also, try to apply in the priority deadlines of universities!\nHope this helps! All the very best!']"

But I did use GREedge and can vouch for it.I recently gave my GRE and can say confidently that I scored a good score. DUring the start of my preparations a few months before I too was confused between the two and while enrolling was thinking on for which of these two online preps should I register for. For me the choice was simple as I did want to score better than last year. I went with GREedge for a simple reason that it's based out of India where I am from and It did have positive reviews and recommendations from some who had earlier enrolled for their prep courses.I enrolled two months before my exam and took an appropriate course. The course material was very thorough, both for the verbal and Quant Sections. Their SFA’s (Student Advisors) were very supportive and did answer all the doubts and questions posed to them, with additional materials to practise whenever requested. I personally found them good at their jobs in guiding students. They also assisted in completing the course on schedule. Their web interface was also pretty adaptable and could start at get go from the very beginning. Just had an issue with their word bots but then am pretty bad at mugging up things leave alone 8000+ words. Even after enrolling to any of the courses (which you must choose after a good research about either of them so that they are suitable for you, just keep in mind its always better if you also parallely prepare in your own time with the additional materials because the better you practise the better score you get. So, all the best."", ""I was enrolled with GRE edge for 4 months and I must say that their service is really pathetic. Their so called “ Personal SFA’s “ call only when they have another offer for u ( like when they want you to subscribe for the TOEFL prep on their portal ). My verbal sfa never picked up the call and their is always this communication gap. What these SFA’s do is basically they chalk out a plan , and that’s it. The plan is created in such a manner that u complete the whole portal before ur GRE (including some style tests and a few full tests as well). So their is no rocket science in this.\nDuring these 4 months , I was contacted only 4–5 times by them . ( That's how personal they get. ) I expected these guys to call me at least before my D day to discuss any sought of plans or strategies or a little motivation maybe!! But I Only received a computer generated mail and text sms saying all the best , and a few tips here and their. That's it.\nContent wise they are okay . But do not expect anything more. Also , their portal looks very out dated and mechanical. ( No videos , only text,) I also found it hard to skip topics sometimes. (Unless you complete the one before ) So it does lack a sense of flexibility .\nThe only thing I liked was the wordbot app which helps u to learn words using mnemonics. You can even revise words by filtering out the list u are focusing on .\nIn conclusion i would say that, it really depends on your preparation level and what score you are aiming for. It’s always better to go for standard books and materials. I haven’t used magoosh , but from what i have heard , their content ,videos,strategies are top notch and they have been in this race for quiet a long time .And they do stand out when it comes to the content. (without any doubt). It would be wise to not get fooled by terms like “Personal SFA” or “Personal tutor”. Ultimately it’s all your effort that adds up. The only reason why i took up online GREEdge was because i had to juggle between my job and gre prep(otherwise i would have opted for physical classes rather than online), and i thought that this concept of “personal SFA” might keep me focused throughout the journey. But only later i realized how cleverly this B.S. concept was sold to me .\nP.S. Not trying to denigrate GreEdge . Some XYZ might have had a better experience than i had, and it’s totally fine. Just thought that it would be great to share it in a forum . Cheers!"", 'I recently gave my GRE scored 311{Q:162;V:149;W:4}. Some may find this to be a very average score as compared to 320+ or 330+ which people get so frequently. Then again we should primarily understand that we do not learn anything new for the purpose of taking GRE, instead our aptitude is tested on the things we already know and have had these stuff as a part of our coursework at some part of our academics. I have a lot of respect for the people who do not prefer any assistance while preparation.\nHowever I felt that I needed some assistance as I was out of touch with academics for 2 years almost. Also the people whom I live with at present are not into such a culture. I enrolled for GRE-EDGE as a few of my batchmates had already excelled in GRE with this organisation and suggested me to take up one of their programs. I would try to be as much unbiased as possible and go on with my experience as I never enrolled for magoosh as most of their material were already availavle in form of free apps or free videos.\nNow what I liked about EDGE was that they had variety of difficulty levels. So I was bound to practice more and more. A personal facilitator is assigned to every enrolled student who would provide constant feedback to the student. In my case I took the initiative to go after my facilitators, I used to e-mail them on a regular basis and they would get back to me on mail with resoonse to each and every query.\nI felt the 2 major regions where I feel I was got the benifit out of the program were:-\nTime Management: EDGE questions(advanced practice+mock) are having higher difficulty levels. In my actual GRE I had a lot of time to go back to each question and revise.\nQuestion Oreintation: My facilitators had mailed me certain materials apart from the learning portal. Mostly PDF samples, which gave me idea on certain tips and tricks(4Q), slideshows for SE and RC tricks, sample essays (4W) rated 1–6 like how I should write and how I should not.\nI feel GRE-EDGE even though is not as famous as magoosh, but they do offer valued service an you can well go ahead with any one of their programs.']"
What are the easiest ways to learn math and vocabulary for the GRE to score above 320?,30 Answers,['GREedge\nGRE Preparation\nVocabulary Development\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nExam and Test Advice\nExam and Test Preparation\nHow-to Question\nExams and Tests\nWhat are the easiest ways to learn math and vocabulary for the GRE to score above 320?'],"[""To those\nWho don’t have much time to prepare, such as those having a job (my case) or too much of college work.\nPreparing on their own, without any coaching. Without any hard books.\nWho are lazy. (Less euphemistically)\nHere’s my brief:\n(It’s quite a long read - TL; DR at the end)\nI was not able to do what they do, owing to the lack of time. These things should not let you down--\n“No time for Mock tests”: I did not take any (of the 3) mock tests fully - I only used to attempt both the Quant sections, review the mistakes, and ultimately end up preparing for Quant only till the day ended. I’d attempted Verbal only once (that too while triple-clicking and peeping at the meaning for each of the words that were unknown to me :P ) and gotten only 20 of 40 correct. This was before I’d started preparations, so I didn’t mind it much.\nLAST MINUTE Preparations: In spite of everyone telling me against it, I couldn’t leave the house in the morning without scrolling through my (mostly unprepared) word list, and the salient Quant mistakes notes.\n“Enough Sleep before the Day”: Didn’t have! :( Feeling underprepared, just twisting on the bed for hours without sleep!\nWhat I can make out now\nAll that last minute anxiety, laziness towards Verbal, the last sleepless night, were all immaterial. For the most important thing is to be Calm & Concentrated during the exam. That’s all! :)\n \nYour score is already decided; a few months’ preparation would be puny in front of the all the Math/English that you’ve acquired during the past 20-25 years of your life.\nThe post by Ananth Balasubramanian is the truest. Sincere thanks to him. :)\n[Here’s the link: GRE brief by Ananth Balasubramanian | Facebook]\nSuggested preparation material (i.e. the ones that I referred to)\nManhattan 5 lb. (the hot favourite) for Quant - being a lover of Maths, I solved all of the problems and tests in this.\nETS Official Guide - devour it completely! Burp!\nETS Quant Practice and ETS Verbal Practice books - the best ones to understand the type & range of questions asked and to develop your own strategies.\nMagoosh Vocabulary Builder app - for the times when I used to take a break or while commuting or that eyes-wide-open-in-the-phone-light time before sleep.\nQuant tips\nPractice all types of questions from all topics. Don’t even ignore simple Algebra questions like “1+3=?”, for there must be a trick involved. Even once would do, if you grasp things quickly.\nThen review the answers and keep jotting down the mistakes you commit. These should be helpful at the LAST MINUTE preparations. (For example, don’t ignore fractions and negative values in x2; double check DI questions; that new formula of ‘sample standard deviation’ etc.) If you have time, do review the answers to the correct ones too - there can be some wisdom provided there too, e.g. in Manhattan and ETS books.\nVerbal tips\nPractise RC as much as you can. It’s not important that you finish the whole book of RC99. I did practise only about 15-20 essays from the books that I’ve mentioned. The important thing is to learn how to critically think about the questions and the choices. Every now and then, you’d have to reason with the choices like: “Hey! The passage does say that Apples are Bad. But it doesn’t state ‘specifically’ that they’re bad in taste. So eliminate.” Reasoning gets even more stringent than this. Learn to do it, and RC is your toy.\nAlso, speed reading in RC helps a lot. Verbal sections might be found to be time-taking by you.\nSE and TC - Go with your instinct. Eliminate. Practice didn’t help me much I guess. But to be confident in the exam, do practise. :)\nAWA tips\nI don’t think I’m the right person to speak about it. I only read a few samples from the ETS OG, on the day before D-day. I like writing, and so I could write quite much in the exam as well.\nAll this I did within 10 days effectively. Lack of sleep didn’t bother me on the test day. (Might bother others, do sleep!)\nHowever, during preparations, I believe sleep matters - for whatever you learn needs the warmth of the pillow to be happy to stay in your brain... :)\nAs much important are everyday chores and play - I used to play at least two games of Carrom everyday during my preparation. But DON’T do anything that brings that guilt in you of having wasted time.\nOn Test Day\nHad slept only for 4 hours the night before, awoke at 6:30 AM, had only one banana for breakfast, and reached the venue at 7:30 AM. To my surprise, security check had already begun! :O Plus, to add to the torment, the ‘Prometric Intro video’ was playing on the TV there in loop! Grrr!\nAWA topics were good, had ample thoughts to write. Time is also enough for you to write 400-500 words.\nHappy to see the Quant section first! :D Got all the answers. However, it was trickier and lengthier than the second Quant section - so I knew that it was experimental.\nAnd most of the verbal passages I got were related to Science - Astronomy, Chemistry, Botany etc. Lucky, for I love to read about those. :)\nA Little Time Hack: Don’t press the Continue button when the section finishes. Take deep breaths. Prepare your mind to shift from Q to V or V to Q. Then press Continue and enjoy an official break of 60 more seconds ... :P (Had read this somewhere, so implemented.)\nBreak time: Snickers. No wonder. (I think ETS should write this in the GRE conventions’ PDF now)\nAll went smooth. And the score screen. My eyes went to the Quantitative section first: 170. Emotionless. Fine. Expected. Then they turned to Verbal section: 159. I added it to my Quant score and... “WTF! It’s becoming 329! Perhaps my brain is too tired to do simple addition now”, I’d said to myself. I did the Math again. And then again on the yellow rough sheet - that’s when it settled in!\nI smiled, filled in the Universities, and went straight to my friends waiting for a party. :)\nTL; DR\nKNOW the question types; PRACTISE until you start getting the answers correct; CHILL often: most importantly, during the exam.\nAll the Best! :)\n[If anyone has any further queries, I'd be happy to help. :) ]\n——————————————————————————————————————————\nUpdate | May 22, 2016\nAdmitted in Texas A&M University, College Station, to the M.Eng. in Construction Engineering & Management program!\nHappy as Hell!! :D\n——————————————————————————————————————————\nUpdate | June 30, 2017\nWorking for one of the largest construction companies in the US!\nHappier!! :D :D"", ""Dear GRE Aspirant!\nTwo key phrases caught my attention in your question: “easiest ways” and “above 320”. Let me begin with the 2nd phrase since it is the more important among the two.\nAn above 320 score is the popular benchmark for the success of your application – although there are many more factors to it. Going by the consensus, here is how a Good and a Great GRE score may look like.\nGood Score\nGreat Score\nAdditionally, why don’t we draw some inference from the statistics for admission to some top-notch colleges in the U.S.:\nThe statistics shown above will convince you of the importance of securing section-wise efficient scores in the GRE. A 165 in Quant, coupled with a 155 in Verbal makes 320, but need not serve the best outcome with respect to your target university. Coming to the other phrase (i.e., easiest ways), you must understand that easy comes from comfort – and that comfort comes from two things: Ability & Alacrity. The better you are at something, the easier it feels. Again, the more prepared you are for something – the easier it becomes. All this philosophy is to help you understand the importance of Planning & Preparation. These two Ps make GRE easier to tame. We will come to this soon!\nTame your Verbal\nLet’s begin with a few things to focus on for your Verbal section:\nWithout discounting the importance of the 3500 high frequency words for GRE, you must also refer Barron’s 333. These are apparently the more frequent ones to occur.\nThe Verbal section of the GRE is not about memory, word power or vocabulary. It is more about analogy, context, and comprehension. Hence, invest in learning the context for each word.Select a handful of words every week – and read at least 5 blogs/articles in context to each such word. This reinforces enough context around the word – making it almost unforgettable.\nThe old strategies of relying on mnemonics, visual/audio, root words, theme based words, synonyms for context, etc. are still extremely effective and relevant. Utilize technology where you can, and rely on building your Verbal foundations using visual & associative methods of learning. Apps like WordBot, Flashcards, are extremely effective in this regard.\nDevelop the habit of speed reading. Only 20% of a sentence is enough for context. This will help you achieve great speed and accuracy (since you wouldn’t be affected by random words in the sentence).\nConquer Quant\nNow, a few hacks for the Quant section:\nMaster Mental Math. A large subset of questions you encounter would be intense with lots of smaller problems leading to the final solution. Mastering Mental Math techniques like Vedic Math etc. will take away the weeds from the path.\nPractice and practice hard, with an intent to solve any question you encounter within 90 seconds. Some solutions could be shorter, say 25 seconds.\nValue your time, but do not rush. Read between the options available and often you will see through the traps GRE sets for all.\nLearn the art of IGMO, i.e., Intelligent Guessing and Moving On. GRE does not penalize a wrong answer. If the questions seem a bit wavering for you, resort to IGMO.\nPick concepts and solve questions based on them. This will enable you to approach each question with an intent to build its back/spine. Once you strengthen the spine, you can take it all!\nAlways try to build a Flow or Diagram for questions. Each question just lays out the facts in front of you. What can be confused by words, can be disseminated by figures!\nLearn to use the Online Calculator. It is an extremely underrated gift/lenience GRE offers. Most people end up solving square roots on paper. Act smarter and use a calculator. All of this is best done when you have a Plan and Preparation in place.\nHow does Planning help?\nPeter Drucker said: “You can't manage what you can't measure”. A plan will help you stay focused and on the sprint. No plan is fool-proof, but a study plan will ensure you are aware of your progress. It will help you mobilize more resources when needed, and prioritize better.\nTake a look at the below figure to understand the same.\nNote that the above data corresponds to aspirants who had invested and dedicated themselves to a Tight Study plan and a Learning Tracker, in their quest for a 320+ score in GRE.\nSample Study Plan Structure based on time period:\n1 month study plan structure\nAllocate at least 4 hours a day to prepare for GRE, diligently – without fail.\nFocus on the toughest problems and concepts.\nCompare your progress with peers and steer your preparation plan daily based on the same.\nTake as many timed and test-environment simulated tests as may be possible.\nBe clear of where you need help and reach to the Personal Coach without any remorse.\n3 months study plan structure\nEnforce Time Management strategies like 2 minute rules for every question.\nWork up stamina for 4 hour tests, by taking regular proctored and simulated tests.\nFocus a lot on deciphering and finding the way through long RCs and passages.\nIdentify weak areas/concepts, and scheduling help sessions for the same.\nBuild a diligent Word consumption strategy (e.g. WordBot, Flashcards, etc.).\nStay well-versed with as many axioms and formulae pertaining to Geometry as possible.\n6 months study plan structure\nA more relaxed approach to building core concepts.\nHeavy focus on building reading habit.\nPeriodicals and editorial sections of top/acclaimed journals are a must. Additionally, classic novels and books are welcome.\nA daily focus on assimilating 10-20 new words from the high frequency list of words.\nWeekly proctored tests to analyze weak areas.\nBuilding good arithmetic and quick math skills.\nStrong focus on practising Data Interpretation and Sentence Equivalence questions, given the time in hand to master the same.\nIt is consistently quipped that 90 days should be a good period to enable your GRE prep. Having said that, you could just get double sure with a 180 day study plan!\nNothing gets easier than following a time tested study plan, especially when someone else out there dedicates all their hours to build your excellence.\nDo not let too much information confuse your choices. Think logically, and you will see that sense prevails by following a stringent study plan.\nAll the best!"", 'GRE stands for Graduate Record Examination. It is held by Educational Testing Service (ETS) and the exam aims to measure verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, analytical writing skills. The GRE format changed in 2011 and is the maximum marks one can score in this revised format is 340 (170 in Quant and 170 in Verbal) and 6 in AWM. An examinee can miss one or more questions on a multiple-choice section  and still receive a perfect score of 170. Likewise, even if no question  is answered correctly, 130 is the lowest possible score.\n\n320 is a very good score and might fetch you an admit from the top schools. Although GRE is not the only parameter taken into account by Schools, it is one of the main parameters. Other factors are TOEFL/IELTS scores, undergrads GPA, internships and projects, work experience in the related field, Statement of Purporse(SOP), the Letters of Recommendation(LOR), extra curriculars.\n\nIn general, to secure a 320+ score, you need to have a very good vocabulary, solid basic concepts in Mathematics and good writing skills.\nBy good vocabulary I mean given a word and 3 different sentences making use of the same word in 3 different contexts, you should be able to differentiate and understand the difference in use of the words.\nFor a good quant score, you should have very clear concepts when it comes to topics like Area, Volume, Indices, Data Interpretation. Each quantitative section consists of about 8 quantitative comparisons, 9  problem solving items, and 3 data interpretation questions.\nThe AWM section will be a cake walk if you are well read and write in some form or the other. The analytical writing section consists of two different essays, an  ""issue task"" and an ""argument task"". The writing section is graded on a  scale of 0–6, in half-point increments.\n\nPRACTICE. PRACTICE. PRACTICE. This is the key to GRE success. The more you practice, the better you will be able to tackle questions in the given amount of time. Solve at least 6 full length tests to become used to the format, questions and time frame. ETS Powerprep tests will give you the closest idea of how much you will score in the actual test.\n\nAll the best :-)', ""I scored a 320+ with Q:170.GRE is a tricky exam which just can't be randomly answered. I started two months prior to the exam. The first thing I did was to research about the books that you will be reading from and here is my view about books:\nETS GRE Official Book- This book is a must, it gives insights to what actual GRE will be and is the closest to GRE level. It contains all information about the exam, practice sets in verbal and Quants and AWA and two written tests. Apart from written tests, you get a CD which contains powerpep software\nManhattan 5LB- This is a comprehensive book, has exhaustive practice sets for RCs, SE and TC and gives you tips to study. I found Quants from Manhattan easy most of the time . It is a recommended book for verbal\nPrinceton Review- This book is for beginners, I would recommend this book only to those who haven't had a chance to verse well with English ,the level is easier than GRE for both Quants and verbal. Don't buy this book if you are well versed with Quants and Verbal.\nAs far as my schedule goes, I had to manage it along with my undergrad( Engineering). I would give 4–5 days a week for verbal ,esp RCs. It's always better to work in group for verbal, discuss with your friends, or your GRE teacher if you have joined tutorials. Focus on vocab, but not too much ,GRE is no longer vocab centric , Manhattan 1000 words, Princeton 1409 and magoosh flash cards are enough for this. Start with your vocab early,read and understand words while you are free, or in your commute. TC and SE are scoring questions ,I focussed more on them rather than RCs.\nComing to Quants, I just used Manhattan 5LB. Since I appeared for JEE Mains engineering entrance exam, which has much higher level mathematics, I didn't find the need to study for GRE, as Quants is more about your basic maths and alertness to tricky questions.\nLastly, I gave a lot of mock exams, 6 Manhattan tests from their portal which costs around $40. 2 Princeton tests and 2 ETS Powerprep. I found Manhattan tests extremely helpful esp in Quants, on other hand I found Princeton verbal easy and Quants nearly same as GRE . Powerprep has two tests and both are of utmost importance, test 1 seems easier than test 2. Your final exams marks can be nearly +/-3 of Powerprep 2 obv not without exceptions\nDon't over study, be calm and chilled for GRE, study regularly, converse with your friends in English or maybe play a vocab game. I used to play vocab game in magoosh with my friends by challenging them.\nAll the best for your GRE!\nProtip: Anytime during exam if you feel that the level of questions has fallen down, realize that you performed bad in the previous section as GRE is adaptive. Rejoice if the level is same or harder :p""]"
How do I best prepare for the GRE?,38 Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nHow do I best prepare for the GRE?'],"[""Hi! I have taken the General GRE exam in March 2017 and scored 329/340 with 163 in Verbal and 166 in Quantitative. I will tell you my experience and in general some tips as to how to fare well on the exam. Nevertheless, preparation strategies vary from person to person.\nIf you want to get an idea as to where you stand even before you start your preparation, I would suggest you to take a free mock test online. I would recommend the one offered by Galvanize. It's not a full test, but has one Verbal section and one Quantitative section. You just need to spend an hour and you would get an idea when you check your scores as to where you made mistakes and which concepts you need to learn better. This, in my opinion, embarks your preparation for GRE!\nThe most important thing to do is to first book your test date. Until and unless your test date is booked, you would not get the requisite motivation to start your preparation. That was what I did. I first scheduled my test and then took the mock to see where I stood. I scored 302/340 in the mock test. I was not at all prepared. So the results were as expected. I found out the concepts I needed to study and started working on them.\nTalking about how much time you need to invest preparing for the test, it is totally dependent on what you do. If you are an engineering student or a mathematics student or someone taking math courses and constantly staying in touch with the subject, I assure you that Quantitative section would be a cakewalk! At the same time, I would like to emphasize that ETS has raised the bars for Quantitative section and it is not as trivial as it once seemed to be (I'm not generalizing anything here; whatever I say is what I opine). If you want to start from scratch and study everything throughly, I'd highly recommend enrolling for some online GRE coaching.\nYou can subscribe for Magoosh as it would prep you up for the toughest questions - questions that are too tough that ETS might not consider asking them- which is a very good thing as you would find the actual test pretty easy! You can take a subscription for three months or six months depending on what is ideal for you and depending on when you have scheduled your test. Do not think of it as a waste of money because in the worst case scenario where you do bad in your first attempt, you might end up wasting more money for your second attempt! So it's okay to spend some money when necessary because it's worth it. :)\nPractice all the material religiously, and work everyday. Make sure you have the ETS official book with you and also download the Powerprep software from ETS website. Set a target, say, that you would complete your first round of preparation in a month and then take the first test on the Powerprep software. Depending on your score, you would know where you stand. You can then improve your score by focusing more on areas where you lost marks. Take the second test one week before your actual test date after you think you're fully prepared. That test is relatively tougher than the first one. Spend the last one week practicing rigorously.\nVerbal\nVocabulary plays a crucial role in Verbal section, but, remember that it is not everything. It contributes to about 20% of your score on verbal section. The most important aspect is practicing comprehensions and text completions. GRE is an exam which you can excel by practicing more and more problems! That's the key to scoring high on GRE. So don't spend too much time simply learning words. Instead, practice more questions and continue learning words. This approach is more helpful.\nQuantitative\nThe key to scoring high on quantitative is practice and practice and practice! Also, remember that the exam would put you under a time pressure. So practice with time and try to do as many questions as you can with minimum number of mistakes. Every question is worth the same score. So focus more on getting questions right than on somehow answering all the questions.\nAnalytical Writing\nIt would suffice to score above 3.5 in this section, but I would suggest you to spend some time and get a better score. It's not all about getting a reasonable score but it's about getting a decent and deserving score. If you're good at essay writing and arguments, you would hardly need to spend any time for this section. Otherwise, you need to practice writing and the more you practice, the better you get at it. ETS asks questions only from the given pool of essays. So make sure to check them out. I have practiced several topics from the pool of essays and scored 5/6 in this section.\nThere are websites that have collections of GRE preparation books including Kaplan, Baron's, Manhattan, Princeton and old ETS books. So try to get them and practice as much as you can! :)\nFinally, I would say practice makes your GRE score perfect! I mean it literally, a perfect score of 340 is attainable with practice. :)\nAll the best!\nPS: I have forgotten to mention this. In order to improve vocabulary on a long-term basis, do study Word Power Made Easy by Nornan Lewis. But this book doesn't cover several GRE words! So please download the app called “Painless GRE”. It has around 4000 words. Once you're done learning them, most of your vocabulary prep is done! :)"", 'Be sure to register early for your GRE exam so that there is enough time to process any necessary paperwork, and so that you can take the exam at the center of your choice and at your desired time and date.

Keep them in mind as you plan your own preparation.\nQuants:\nThe topics the questions are based on are simple, it is the questions that are tricky.\nThe GRE mentions certain instructions - read the question carefully, figures are not drawn to scale, etc - which seem fairly obvious. However, since we’re always in a hurry to solve the sum and move on, we tend to make silly mistakes, which will cost us that easy extra point in the exam.\nOne method I personally found useful to fix this was using Manhattan’s 8 Strategy guides. These books actually detail a majority of the types of tricks the GRE will use to trick you. Compiling a list of tricks that I always seemed to fall for and revising them before every test I gave, helped keep me aware of the possible tricks I could encounter as soon as I saw a sum, thus improving my accuracy.\nAim to maximize your quants score as far as possible. Practice a lot, the Manhattan 5 lb. book has a lot of great sums. Solve from the ETS Official books without fail.\nVerbal:\nStart the word lists as early as possible, ideally much before you start actual prep even. Use the time you take to travel to and from college or work to do these words. The word lists I did were Magoosh (excluding advanced), Manhattan and Barrons 1100.\nAnother thing to practice beforehand is reading. GRE Reading Comprehensions are dreaded by all. The language can be quite tough and attempting to understand it can drain your mental energy. Couple that with long, winding passages? You just might fall asleep in the middle of the RC itself. Train yourself not only to read long passages and but to read those passages with the same attentiveness throughout. Building this stamina will help you on test day, when sitting for nearly four hours straight will already be a drain on your energy.\nFor the individual Verbal question types, the only mantra is practice, practice and practice. But don’t just blindly solve 100 questions at a go, as tempting as that may be. Solve sets of 20 questions of a particular question type, note down the mistakes made and reflect on what could be done to rectify it. Note down these strategies and read through them from time to time, especially emphasizing on mistakes that you make often.\nETS Official books, Manhattan 5 lb, Princeton’s 1014 GRE Questions (for TCs and SEs) and Verbal Grail (for RCs) were some of the books I used. Many people swear by Word Power Made Easy for building language as well, although I’ve never used it. A lot of the articles on the Magoosh blog are also helpful in devising strategies to solve particular question types.\nTests:\nGive as many tests as you can. The GRE is a long exam. Therefore, it is necessary to build up the stamina to maintain your focus throughout the exam.\nAWA:\nAWA was a last moment thing for me. Went through the Manhattan AWA Strategy Guide and picked up a few pointers, which I then applied on exam day.\nPractice a few essays beforehand. You should make sure that you are able to complete them while ensuring that they were also of appropriate length.\nLastly, finding a group of friends or a buddy at work who is giving the GRE as well is definitely a boon. A bunch of my friends gave the GRE at the same time as I did and discussing words from time to time, sharing resources and solving each others doubts definitely helped sharpen my own skills.\nIf you prefer a week by week plan, check out this answer :\nSuhail Barot's answer to How should I prepare for GRE in one month to score 320 +?\nHope this helps :)"", 'Thanks for A2A.\nPlease follow the below the steps to apply for GRE-\nGo to https://www.ets.org/gre and click on Register Now at the left bottom of the screen.\nYou will be taken to login window, select Create or Login to your ETS Account now\nCreate your account using your email-id and choose your password.\nOnce done you will be redirected to your dashboard\nSelect Register/Find Test Centres, Dates\nSelect your test centers, dates accordingly and proceed with the payment.\nPlease use a credit card for payment.\nHope this helps.

How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,100+ Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I plan my preparation for the GRE?'],"['GRE has three main components namely verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing. Your entire preparation process should revolve around acquiring good skills on these areas and mastering the concepts required.\nSome of the things which you can do to get the required concept clarity are\nQuantitative reasoning:\nThe best part about GRE Math is the absence of things which most of us hate in Math - The integral calculus, trigonometry and other complicated stuff. GRE Math is mostly things which you learned in junior/ high school - Things like interger properties, word problems (rate of work, speed, probability etc) which can be solved with basic common sense. Not much beyond that.\nWhat makes the GRE so tricky is the interpretation of the questions part. Once you figure out what the question is asking, the math involved is definitely easier than what you faced in your high school. In fact, it is more fun as you don\'t need to write down each and every step and show your teacher on how you arrived at your answer. You just need to pick an answer. In short, the math section just tests your ability to reason with numbers.\nVerbal reasoning:\nVerbal reasoning section is even more simple with there being only 3 question types - text completion, critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The preparation process should be fully focused on knowing specific strategies for cracking these questions rather than generic preparation advocated.\nFor example, use of flash cards for learning new words was very helpful in the earlier format of the test where antonyms and analogies were asked and there was more emphasis on rote learning of words. But, the current format focuses more on understanding not only the literal meaning of the words but also the metaphorical use of the word based on the context. For example, while the word \'opaque\' literally means \'not transparent\', it could also mean \'difficult to interpret or understand\' if used in the right context. Similarly, there are no questions asking you to identify any grammar errors. Grammar is important only for your essay writing section. Hence, it makes sense not to rely on these old fashioned methods advocated by coaching institutes but to just keep focusing on the 3 question types.\nAnalytical writing:\nAnalytical writing section asks you to write 2 essays - one on ""The Issue"" and the other on ""The Argument"". The major difference here is in the first essay you are asked to take a stand on a complex issue whereas in the second essay you are asked to dissect the logic behind an already taken stand or position.\nHow do I prepare for this? You just need to follow a simple routine and you are guaranteed to score well in this section.\nChoose - Structure - Write - Compare - Improve - Choose\nStep 1: You choose a topic where you already have some well written sample essays. You can pick these up either in the official site or from the many blogs available online.\nStep 2: Come up with a structure and an outline.\nStep 3: Write an essay by developing the structure and the outline.\nStep 4: Compare it with other essays written on the topic.\nStep 5: Rewrite your essay to improve it.\nStep 6: Go to Step 1.\n--------------------\nIf you do all of the above, you are going to definitely score well on your GRE.\nCheck out Magnus Prep\'s GRE Program if you are looking for some great mentors to help with your GRE preparation.\nCheers!', 'When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.\n\nNote: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.\n\n1. First Month: Conditioning\nAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don\'t have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nWork out (don\'t just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.\nIn parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well)\n\nFourth Week:\nTime for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don\'t forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)\nMeanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.\n\nSo, it\'s been one month now. Don\'t expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.\n\n2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull\'s Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way\nNow it\'s time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don\'t think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I\'m going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nSign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It\'s a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.\nJoin the New GRE group on Facebook. It\'s the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:\nMembers post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.\nSecondly, it\'s a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation.\nYou\'ll get access to some really USEFUL links.\nThe next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.\nThe last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don\'t forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.\nNow you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it\'s time for some real action !!\nFourth Week\nTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that\'s all its useful for. Don\'t expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms\n\n3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racer\n\nFirst Two Weeks\nPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don\'t leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don\'t, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn\'t take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I\'m telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.\n\nLast Two Weeks\nIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I\'d read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:\n\n20 online tests\n\n800Score\'s Free Full Length Revised GRE Test\n\nMyGRETutor\'s 4 free Full Length Tests\n\nKaplan\'s Free Practice Test Options for the GRE\n\nPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length test\n\nIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!\n\nOriginally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?', 'Quant - 170 Verbal- 164 AWA- 4.5/6\nI recently gave my GRE on 28th September 2017. Although I started my preparation 3 months prior to the examination I could not continue due to the fact that I am also preparing for other competitive exams. Also I was put down by Chicken pox and Typhoid for a month. Effectively I had little more than a month to prepare for the test. So I was quite surprised with the result that I got as you can see above. Here is how I prepared for my GRE test.\nStudy Material -\nMagoosh GRE prep account (most important)\nMagoosh Vocabulary builder (words flashcard app)\nManhattan prep GRE 5 lb. book of gre practice problems\nManhattan GRE Prep Reading comprehension and Essay\nOfficial Guide for GRE by ETS (all three books)\nVarious news sites such as The New Yorker , The Economist etc. ( as prescribed on Magoosh GRE blog).\nStudy Plan -\nI started my preparation at the start of the month of July . As I told earlier I am also studying for other competitive exams so I could’nt devote much time to GRE. I studied for maximum 3 hours each day. I also did’nt study according to any plan. Some days it was only vocab building by flashcards and reading articles. Some days it was practicing problems Some days divided between both. Also I watched Magoosh GRE video lessons and I can say they were very useful.\nThis is a tip for students from engineering background preparing for GRE. Don’t ignore the quantitative section even if it seems easy to you. Practice it as you would the verbal section.\nAfter recovering from my maladies I had approx 5 weeks to prepare for GRE. So I decided to tidy up my routine so\nI increased my GRE study time to 5–6 hours per day\nIn a day I would first go through my magoosh flashcards and try to learn atleast 30 new words per day and also revise a few old words. Also I made a point to read and understand atleast 2 news articles per day .\nThen I would practice quantitative for approx 1 hour . I generally used timed custom practice test in Magoosh GRE account.\nFor next 2 hours I would go through practicing the verbal section and writing essays.\nI learnt how to read the paragraphs swiftly and in detail. Again Magoosh video lessons were very important in this regard.\nUnfortunately I was not able to give any full practice test due to my surroundings but I would recommend everyone to give atleast one of them.\nMy main focus was on improving my vocab by learning new words , their meaning and context of their uses as it appeared to me to be very useful for Sentence equivalence and Text completion questions. Again and I cannot stress this enough watching Magoosh video lessons was very important.\nI practiced and practiced as much as my schedule allowed me to.\nOn the day of the examination\nReach the centre atleast 1 hour prior to the commencement of test as there are plenty of verification to be done before the examination. Also carry a water bottle with you. GRE is very attentively conducted examination and staff of testing centres are very vigilant. If you have any problem feel free to ask for their help.\nGRE is a very easy exam as you can see in my case , with a directed and concentrated approach you can score very well ( 330+) within a relatively short amount of prep time.\nBe well , Be prepared and best of luck.', 'I’ve been tutoring the GRE for a number of years. The below is inspired by the many sessions I’ve had with students, many of whom have gone on to do very well on the GRE. A lot of it is also specific to the revised GRE, which made its debut in August 2011.\n \n1. Use official material\n \nWhen preparing for the GRE, no questions prepare you better than the ones written by ETS, which is responsible for writing the questions you will see test day. As much as possible, stick to the questions in the Official Guide to the GRE so you can wrap your mind around how the test writers want you to reason.\n \nYou may not think that it makes that much of a difference, but many publishers out there have questions that require you to make certain leaps of logic—or employ questionable logic—that you will never have to do on the actual test. Then there is the fact that many questions simply aren’t as difficult or nuanced as the questions you’ll see test day. This is a problem many students encounter when using Kaplan—you are essentially taking a dumbed down version of the GRE, with often poorly constructed questions to boot.\n \n\n2. Take practice tests\n \nThere is no better way to prepare for test day than actually taking a mock test. You will train yourself to sit for three plus hours staring at a screen, as you are pummeled by an onslaught of GRE problems.\n \nIf possible, use only the official tests, found in the Official Guide to the New GRE. There are four such tests—two that comes with the book, and two that are computer-based and come with the CD that is part of the book. Stagger these out  over the four weeks you are prepping, so that there are no fewer than five days between tests and no more than ten days. If you are studying longer, you might also want to consider Manhattan GRE tests (see below).\n \nFinally, practice tests will allow you to better assess your strengths and weaknesses, and help inform your study sessions in between tests.\n \n \n3. Focus on weaknesses\n \nMake sure not to get carried away developing those areas in which you already excel. For instance, if you are generally strong at math problem solving questions, but if you dislike Data Interpretation (that’s the section with all the graphs), then the last thing you want to do is avoid that section. Instead make it a priority to become confident and effective at all questions relating to Data Interpretation.\n \n \n4. Use the best material\n \nWhile official material is clearly the best prep out there, it doesn’t necessarily provide the most effective strategies. You may want to take a look at Princeton Review for helpful big picture strategies. As for specific strategies for almost every aspect of the GRE—from permutations to convoluted paragraph arguments—the Manhattan GRE books (MGRE) are the best. MGRE also has six practice tests that mimic the actual test very well (though this more so with math than with verbal). For more practice on the online format, Magoosh also offers questions that are similar to--and often more difficult--than those found on the actual test. (I should probably mention that I work for Magoosh :))\n \nOf course there is a lot of material out there that should be avoided, especially in terms of practice content.

As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation.\nYou\'ll get access to some really USEFUL links.\nThe next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.\nThe last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don\'t forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.\nNow you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group.

Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that\'s all its useful for. Don\'t expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms\n\n3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racer\n\nFirst Two Weeks\nPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don\'t leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don\'t, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn\'t take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I\'m telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.\n\nLast Two Weeks\nIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I\'d read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought.

"Why do we often hear about perfect SAT scores, but never about perfect GRE scores?",15 Answers,"['The GRE and Postgraduate University Admissions\nSAT and University Admissions\nSAT (Scholastic Assessment Test)\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nCollege and University Admissions\nWhy do we often hear about perfect SAT scores, but never about perfect GRE scores?']","[""Because at the time of grad school application, the tests matter much less in comparison to grades and recommendations, the candidate pool is much stronger (and thus differentiation in test scores translates poorly to differentiation in candidate quality), and a perfect GRE is very rare on account of the verbal. So you're unlikely to meet someone with a perfect GRE, and if you did, it wouldn't mean very much.\nThere's also a big difference between the verbal and the math. A perfect GRE math is actually common among STEM applicants, and for top schools, a near-perfect GRE math is almost a requirement to make it past the initial round of application review and get your application in front of the eyes actual professors. This is because the GRE math is easy for STEM students, since it doesn't really test anything beyond basic high school math. There is almost no ability to differentiate between top students using the GRE math, since everyone bunches up at 170 (800 on the old scale).\nThe verbal, on the other hand, is very difficult to get a perfect score. Only philosophy majors seem to do well, with 4.8% getting a perfect score, and English majors at about 2%, and almost all other majors well below 1%. Compare that with STEM, where most majors seem to land about 5-10% at a perfect score. So the verbal score is more of a bottleneck to a perfect overall GRE than the math.\nMoreover, there isn't a great overlap between majors that score perfectly on verbal and those that score perfectly on math. Perfect verbal for STEM majors is super rare, but also nearly useless for STEM grad schools. Therefore a perfect all around GRE has little signal value, it's just about the math. I'm not sure how it is for humanities applicants, but I imagine that acing the math does little for your application (and my guess is that acing the verbal is also not much of an addition to an application). So a perfect GRE just doesn't mean very much at the grad level.\nThe SAT on the other hand, is given at a stage when students are expected to be generalists, and undergrad applicants are admired for their well-roundedness, and recommendations from high school contacts carry much less weight. There isn't much else to go on in the application basket, so a standardized test given to all applicants provides a reasonable source if differentiation."", ""In addition to earlier comments about the relatively low number of GRE test-takers, I would like to add that it is pretty awkward to publicize your GRE scores. I received a perfect score on both the math and verbal portions of the GRE. Coming out of a physics department at an Ivy League school, there was a basic understanding that you should probably get an 800 on the math section. If you didn't, that would be embarrassing; if you did, great, join the club. As for verbal, it was clear that no one cared. When I mentioned my verbal score at one point to my graduate school advisor, it became apparent he hadn't even looked at my scores. When a friend in my cohort asked and learned about my verbal score and then told someone else, I was actually rather mortified. I didn't want to seem like that awkward 17-year-old whose identity is wrapped up in doing well on the SAT. At some point during college (if not before), you realize that intelligence and potential are not really reflected in the ability to memorize and regurgitate information for a standardized test. Everyone else seems to realize that too -- which is why the GRE is occasionally used to weed folks out but does not usually carry much weight in graduate school admissions.  Sharing my test scores not only made me feel like a braggart, but even worse like a braggart boasting of something rather trivial."", ""GRE and SAT are very different in exam structure, difficulty and relevance. It isn't a surprise that they have a huge difference when it comes to scoring. There are basically 3 main reasons for it.\nThe Typical population : About 1.7 million people take the SAT every year while just about 580 thousand people take the GRE. Now, surveys denote that almost all the students who attempt the SATs use the SAT Score for their admissions i.e. they are serious about it. While a huge chunk of people who take the GRE, also take the GMAT hence making the serious population thinner.\nThe Typical Colleges : Typically almost all top undergraduate programs which ask for the SAT Score want a perfect or a near perfect scorer as their intake. While the isnt the case for the GRE taking grad schools. They have an amazing amount of other parameters to look for while deciding their ideal student so the GRE score gets somewhat sidelined. Hence making it a sub-standard requirement which in turn makes the occurrence if a perfect GRE Score scarce.\nGRE is tougher : To be honest this reason is not that predominant as the above too but is still worth the mention. The GRE curriculum and question quality is higher when compared to SAT, making scoring s perfect score relatively hard.\nHope this was useful!\nJust a FYI, I do work for an Ed-Tech firm based out of New Delhi, India which is aimed at building awesome careers abroad! Check us out at http://www.leverageedu.com\nIf you want to take this discussion further forward or you want any help regarding your career, feel free to reach me out at samrat@leverageedu.com"", ""Two answers.\n1. GRE is a bit harder than the SAT. But this is likely a small factor (if at all).\n2. Most importantly, a LOT fewer people take the GRE.  Consider that most college bound high school seniors take the SAT. That's millions of students every year.  Not all of these students will graduate with an undergraduate degree.  Now consider that only a tiny fraction of those graduates are interested in post-graduate education. Now consider that there are different exams for different areas, GMAT, GRE, etc. So now the number of students will be a tiny fraction of those who took the SAT.\nThe rest is simple math. If the same ratio of people get perfect scores on the GRE as do on the SAT, that means for every perfect SAT score you hear about, you might have a 1% or less chance of hearing about a perfect GRE score.""]"
How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,100+ Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I plan my preparation for the GRE?'],"['GRE has three main components namely verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing. Your entire preparation process should revolve around acquiring good skills on these areas and mastering the concepts required.\nSome of the things which you can do to get the required concept clarity are\nQuantitative reasoning:\nThe best part about GRE Math is the absence of things which most of us hate in Math - The integral calculus, trigonometry and other complicated stuff. GRE Math is mostly things which you learned in junior/ high school - Things like interger properties, word problems (rate of work, speed, probability etc) which can be solved with basic common sense. Not much beyond that.\nWhat makes the GRE so tricky is the interpretation of the questions part. Once you figure out what the question is asking, the math involved is definitely easier than what you faced in your high school. In fact, it is more fun as you don\'t need to write down each and every step and show your teacher on how you arrived at your answer. You just need to pick an answer. In short, the math section just tests your ability to reason with numbers.\nVerbal reasoning:\nVerbal reasoning section is even more simple with there being only 3 question types - text completion, critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The preparation process should be fully focused on knowing specific strategies for cracking these questions rather than generic preparation advocated.\nFor example, use of flash cards for learning new words was very helpful in the earlier format of the test where antonyms and analogies were asked and there was more emphasis on rote learning of words. But, the current format focuses more on understanding not only the literal meaning of the words but also the metaphorical use of the word based on the context. For example, while the word \'opaque\' literally means \'not transparent\', it could also mean \'difficult to interpret or understand\' if used in the right context. Similarly, there are no questions asking you to identify any grammar errors. Grammar is important only for your essay writing section. Hence, it makes sense not to rely on these old fashioned methods advocated by coaching institutes but to just keep focusing on the 3 question types.\nAnalytical writing:\nAnalytical writing section asks you to write 2 essays - one on ""The Issue"" and the other on ""The Argument"". The major difference here is in the first essay you are asked to take a stand on a complex issue whereas in the second essay you are asked to dissect the logic behind an already taken stand or position.\nHow do I prepare for this? You just need to follow a simple routine and you are guaranteed to score well in this section.\nChoose - Structure - Write - Compare - Improve - Choose\nStep 1: You choose a topic where you already have some well written sample essays. You can pick these up either in the official site or from the many blogs available online.\nStep 2: Come up with a structure and an outline.\nStep 3: Write an essay by developing the structure and the outline.\nStep 4: Compare it with other essays written on the topic.\nStep 5: Rewrite your essay to improve it.\nStep 6: Go to Step 1.\n--------------------\nIf you do all of the above, you are going to definitely score well on your GRE.\nCheck out Magnus Prep\'s GRE Program if you are looking for some great mentors to help with your GRE preparation.\nCheers!', 'When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.\n\nNote: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.\n\n1. First Month: Conditioning\nAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don\'t have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nWork out (don\'t just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.\nIn parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well)\n\nFourth Week:\nTime for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don\'t forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)\nMeanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.\n\nSo, it\'s been one month now. Don\'t expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.\n\n2.

(I should probably mention that I work for Magoosh :))\n \nOf course there is a lot of material out there that should be avoided, especially in terms of practice content.

How do I score 320 in GRE in 20 days?,17 Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nHow do I score 320 in GRE in 20 days?'],"[""Making time would be your biggest concern so you will have to make time everyday or squeeze it into your busy schedule. You need to know the following about the GRE exam before you start your preparation.\nThe GRE exam has 3 sections the analytical writing section, the verbal section and the quants section.\nThe analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to your GRE score so you needn’t break your head about it.\nThe Quants and verbal section are for 170 marks each. The quants is the scoring section and you should ideally be looking to get 170/170 in this section. Anything more than 160 is a great score when it comes to verbal.\nYou are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 minutes in each of these sections.\nSomething that most of the people don’t know is that the GRE is actually only for 80 marks but the marks are awarded out of 320 so that we don’t assume that a person who scores a 40 is only half as good as a person who scores 80 so the scores are given on a scale of 260–340.\nYou needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.\nGetting to the hardest part of it all PREPARATION:\nYou needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.\nMost people find the Quants section easy so you should just be trying to brush up on your basic concepts. I would suggest you make your concepts concrete and don’t get carried away in cramming as many formulas as possible. Once you’re confident enough try taking up a mock test and see where you stand, analyze your mistakes and then go back to those topics and make sure that there isn’t an Achilles heel. Spend as little time as possible preparing for Quants and I don’t think it will take up a lot of time. 1 hour a day for a month and you should be good to go.\nThe dicey section is the verbal section and it will definitely be the make or mar factor in your GRE since you may not be accustomed to the language used. The best way to prepare for the verbal section is to READ. The verbal section is predominantly vocabulary based and being thorough with vocabulary might just make the difference between you getting into an average institute or premier institute abroad.\nPlease try to stick to the following schedule:\nSpend two hours each day for the verbal section of GRE and one hour for the Quants section.\nMake sure that your preparation doesn't take a back seat during the weekends or due to some occasion like a friend's birthday.\nGRE Quants in a week:\nPeople are usually comfortable with the Quants section. If you are from an engineering or science background, you are already leaps and bounds ahead of your peers.\n1.Brush up your concepts and make sure you don’t get carried away and cram as many formulas as you can.\n2. Make sure that you approach each problem logically .\n3. Cover all the bases and make sure to go through each topic since Quants is a scoring section and you should ideally be aiming for 170/170 and nothing else.\n4. Practice each type of question and double check the concepts from high school that you never really understood but chose to skip anyway :P\n5. Be stubborn and don’t proceed until you get it right.\nCheck out the best self study partner for cracking the GRE Quants section. I am pretty sure you will find this useful.\nGRE verbal in 10 days:\nGRE is predominantly a vocabulary based section. The quants section of the GRE isn’t very hard to crack and the analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to you GRE score. The verbal section will generally be the make or mar factor in your GRE and will make the difference between you getting into a premier institute or average institute abroad. If you are from an English medium school you would already be strong with your basics which makes it all the more easy for you to prepare yourself. Being thorough with the high frequency words can actually help you a lot. Check out the Barron’s 333.\nThere are very few types of questions in the verbal section like text completion, sentence correction, reading comprehension and critical reasoning. I highly recommend the GRE verbal prep: A definitive guide. It is probably the best study material for a quick preparation. There are loads of practice questions and tests that are available along with videos which will definitely help you remember the words and their in-context meaning. Several shortcuts, tips and mnemonics are also a part of the videos. When you connect things with pictures, you remember them better which is exactly what the videos do. The etymology of the words are also dealt with in detail so that you can understand how a word came into existence and how it has evolved over the years.\nThe MOCK frenzy with an error log:\nYou still have a few days left. You should be taking up as many mock tests as possible. Go CRAZY!\nKeep solving questions and analyzing them.\nKeep a check on your progress.\nIdentify the topics which aren’t really comfortable with. They may turn out to be the Achilles Heel on the day of the exam so don’t leave anything to chance.\nThere is no point in solving umpteen number of problems from topics which are your strong suit. Solve more problems related to the topic which you aren’t comfortable with\nSolve → Analyze → Identify errors → solve more → Repeat\nOn the day before the exam JUST CHILL. Stop learning and don’t learn anything new since it is more likely that you will get confused because of it. Brush up on the concepts and KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK!\nA few of the following tips may come in handy:\nThe GRE is a timed test: If we had all the time we need, then every one of us would get the perfect score on the GRE. But the GRE is a timed test, so it is important to not only be accurate but also quick when it comes to answering the questions. So when preparing for the GRE, time yourself. You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 mins both in the Verbal and the Quants section. Attempt a lot of mock tests it will help you a lot.\nBe aware of the wrong answers:\nThe wrong answers generally tend to fall under certain categories which will help you eliminate the wrong choices when it comes to the GRE verbal reasoning section or reading comprehensions.\nThe choices are most probably wrong if they:\nAssume too much\nAre beyond the scope of the passage\nAre too extreme\nAre true but involve outside knowledge\nAre too specific/too broad\nSave the worst for the last:\nThey usually say save the best for the last but it doesn’t hold good when it comes to the competitive exams like GRE. You will end up wasting time if you attempt the unfamiliar questions. If you find a question complex, it is better to leave it for the time being and improve your score by answering the questions related to the easier and familiar questions.\nUtilize the scratch pad:\nTake short notes while reading the comprehension passage in the space allotted. Eliminate the unnecessary details and words which are just present to throw you off.\nThe following are a few tips that might come in handy when it comes to the reading comprehension but they might also be applied to any question in the verbal section.\nDUMB them down:\nQuestions on reading comprehension passages have the most gray area when compared to any other type of question in the GRE.\nAvoid skimming through the questions without understanding what is specifically being asked. If you find a question or choice confusing rephrase the question in your one words.\nBe on the look out for concessions:\nIn many cases, the author may have a strong voice towards a certain topic or aspect in the passages. The author might have a strong opinion towards certain aspects in a passage and argue for it throughout the passage but then the author might suddenly stop doing so and make subtle or drastic concessions to the opposing side which will weaken the arguments that were previously made in the reading comprehension passage. Make sure that you aren’t thrown by such concessions.\nMake use of the context:\nIf the question asked is related to a specific line in the reading comprehension passage, it won’t help if you just go back and read the sentence. The thumb rule is to read at least one sentence before and after the aforementioned line.\nZero in on the idea behind the longer passages:\nMajority of the reading comprehension passages that you will come across while taking the GRE will be short but on the off chance that you encounter one or two longer ones, it is advisable to focus more on the first and last paragraphs of the passage and find the big picture of the passage, since time is of the essence.\nFind the tone of the passage:\nThe tone of the passage can be found using the choice of words or the turn of phrases used by the author. Even if the tone appears to be neutral, assume that it is complex and look for the tone. You can arrive at the tone by observing the diction or by asking the following questions:\nDoes the author feel positively or negatively about a certain topic?\nWhat aspect of the topic does the author criticize?\nWhat concerns does the author raise through the passage?\nWhich adverbs and adjectives does the author use to voice his opinion?\nLast but not the least\nWatch your diet: An important factor which most students ignore to their detriment is their health and diet. This is very important both during your preparation and while taking the test. Ensure that you stick to a nutritious diet since you will need a lot of energy during your preparation. It is a good thing to avoid eating outside especially junk food, during your preparatory phase. Also, refrain from drinking, partying and taking recreational drugs a week or two before the Test day.\nP.S. If you are looking for study material I would recommend the following:\nGRE verbal prep - A definitive guide\nGRE Prep: Crack the Quantitative Reasoning Section\nGre Prep: Crack the Analytical Writing Assessment Section Effortlessly\nGood Luck!"", 'I scored 336 on my first shot (V166 V170,) and 20 is about the number of days I actually spent on studying for it. However, I started with a good foundation. With my SAT history and intense workload at college, I scored 320+ on my first mock test after I reviewed the vocabulary — in other words, it took me nothing but memorizing a few words to get myself at around 320.\nPeople at different levels or from different backgrounds require different strategies and time investment to reach that 320 goal. Regardless, the 20 days I spent got me 15+ points further. I can’t tell you how to reach 320 without knowing much about your background and needs, but I can tell you how to utilize a shorter time period to make some good progress:\nFocus. The famous 80/20 Rule states that roughly 80% of your outcomes come from 20% of your inputs.[1] This applies to GRE as well. There will be areas on GRE where you can most quickly improve. When the time is limited, you need to focus on those areas to make the most progress. Take a few mock tests and find those spots, and work on them relentlessly.\nMake mistakes. Don’t worry about them at all. It is a good thing to find yourself making mistakes when you’re practicing than you do on the real test. When you practice, you want to expose all the possible ways you make mistakes, and then find ways to avoid them. The reality is, aside from the vocabulary, GRE hardly covers anything that esoteric. In many cases, it’s the silly mistakes you make that really keeps you from getting your dream score. Learning how to avoid those mistakes can allow you to improve quickly. You just need to identify them first, by making them.\nAnalyze. Don’t just practice questions after questions. Think about them. Find patterns, find how you get them wrong, and find quicker ways to solve these questions. At the end of the day, it’s not the quantity of questions that you practiced on that matters the most, it’s how you treat them. Don’t just focus on getting the questions right, focus on how to get better.\nConsolidate. After you’ve practiced, made mistakes, and analyzed them, now it’s time to consolidate your takeaways. Make yourself a list of actions you can take during the actual test to help yourself perform better. This could include double checking your zeros, or being more alarmed of particular words, or things you tend to forget or overlook. Take a good look at them before you take the test.\nMany of my friends have asked me how I got the score I have. Frankly this is it. Now I’m building Gregory to help people do these things automatically. I’d be happy to hear any thoughts/feedback on it.\nFootnotes\n[1] What Is The 80/20 Rule And Why It Will Change Your Life', '20 Days - it is a really small amount for preparation, but you can manage it. Mind increasing the number of hours you’ll dedicate in studying (10 hours a day would suffice).\nThis course gives you 2 weeks to be prepared - Fast and Smart GRE Prep Course by Nova Press. It is designed for those with only 2 weeks or more to prepare with strategies and tips you need to prepare FAST.\nHere is a schedule guide in Mastering Words for you:\nI am using the SMART Objective way in helping me prepare for any exam. Identifying the SMART Objective of your GRE Preparation would somehow look like this:\nS - Specific: Your end-goal should be stated, for example: Be confident when taking the GRE exam because I have prepared very well, studied every topic and even had practice tests to enhance more my skills. It should include the “W” questions: Who? What? Where? When? Which? and Why?\nM - Measurable: A proper schedule should be created and maintained. Establish a concrete number - how many number of words would you like to master? How many weeks would you like to spend for each GRE section? How will I determine if I have accomplished it?\nA - Achievable: A schedule with defined time and activity is something needed for preparation. Make sure that the words you wanted to master and the time you want to prepare would be achievable. Also, practice as many mock test as possible to avoid cram during exam.\nR - Realistic: Provide each list of words a realistic time to finish. Let’s say a list of 10 words can be mastered in 3 days or maybe a week. That includes reviewing it through games/the help of vocab app. I suggest you use Preped Vocab - for free. (But that depends on you)\nT - Time-based: Schedule, schedule, schedule. :)\nFor more help, we have asked a couple of GRE tutors and authors with the following questions.

(Quantitative Section)\nHelpful Tips For Anyone Interested In Taking The GRE\nAre Practice Tests Harder Than The Actual Test For GMAT or GRE?', ""It's doable, but I gotta say, it's really really hard. GRE is designed to test your accumulated knowledge and not meant for last minute crammers. Here's some things you can do.\nYou simply don't have the time to significantly improve your vocabulary. But the good news is, even with an average vocabulary, achieving a verbal score above 155 is feasible. But do make sure to familiarize yourself with Barron's 333 high frequency words.\nReading comprehension questions are the most tricky questions in the GRE. Devote some time to regularly practice these questions and check the answer explanations. Search and watch for Magoosh's videos on RC questions as well as other types of questions to help you out.\nMost people suggest Manhattan and Barron's series for quant and verbal prep and they are probably right. Since I had an engineering background, quant was never a problem for me. My only suggestion for quant, PRACTICE.\nETS quant questions have some really well hidden traps and even the most adept candidates fall prey to these traps. So read every question correctly. It's not rocket science, just keen observation. Again, keep practicing to remove silly mistakes.\nBe sure to reserve the last 6-7 days for full GRE practice. It's not easy to stay focussed, and keep looking at a computer screen for four hours straight, and keep your mind sharp in the process. Only practice will make you get used to the strain.\nWhile taking the full tests, work on your timing and pacing. You might discover a strategy that works best for you. For example, may be you find geometry questions easy and solving them first will leave you more time for the rest of the questions. Same goes for the verbal.\nFor the awa section (which cannot be taken for granted BTW), I suggest to first go through the ETS official guide, and then magoosh videos to get an idea of the general template.\nThere is only one way of acing the GRE: practice. Spend the first 9-11 days familiarizing with the exam pattern and the type of questions and devote the rest for practicing. I wish you all the best for your exam. Best of luck.""]"

How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,100+ Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I plan my preparation for the GRE?'],"['GRE has three main components namely verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing. Your entire preparation process should revolve around acquiring good skills on these areas and mastering the concepts required.\nSome of the things which you can do to get the required concept clarity are\nQuantitative reasoning:\nThe best part about GRE Math is the absence of things which most of us hate in Math - The integral calculus, trigonometry and other complicated stuff. GRE Math is mostly things which you learned in junior/ high school - Things like interger properties, word problems (rate of work, speed, probability etc) which can be solved with basic common sense. Not much beyond that.\nWhat makes the GRE so tricky is the interpretation of the questions part. Once you figure out what the question is asking, the math involved is definitely easier than what you faced in your high school. In fact, it is more fun as you don\'t need to write down each and every step and show your teacher on how you arrived at your answer. You just need to pick an answer. In short, the math section just tests your ability to reason with numbers.\nVerbal reasoning:\nVerbal reasoning section is even more simple with there being only 3 question types - text completion, critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The preparation process should be fully focused on knowing specific strategies for cracking these questions rather than generic preparation advocated.\nFor example, use of flash cards for learning new words was very helpful in the earlier format of the test where antonyms and analogies were asked and there was more emphasis on rote learning of words. But, the current format focuses more on understanding not only the literal meaning of the words but also the metaphorical use of the word based on the context. For example, while the word \'opaque\' literally means \'not transparent\', it could also mean \'difficult to interpret or understand\' if used in the right context. Similarly, there are no questions asking you to identify any grammar errors. Grammar is important only for your essay writing section. Hence, it makes sense not to rely on these old fashioned methods advocated by coaching institutes but to just keep focusing on the 3 question types.\nAnalytical writing:\nAnalytical writing section asks you to write 2 essays - one on ""The Issue"" and the other on ""The Argument"". The major difference here is in the first essay you are asked to take a stand on a complex issue whereas in the second essay you are asked to dissect the logic behind an already taken stand or position.\nHow do I prepare for this? You just need to follow a simple routine and you are guaranteed to score well in this section.\nChoose - Structure - Write - Compare - Improve - Choose\nStep 1: You choose a topic where you already have some well written sample essays. You can pick these up either in the official site or from the many blogs available online.\nStep 2: Come up with a structure and an outline.\nStep 3: Write an essay by developing the structure and the outline.\nStep 4: Compare it with other essays written on the topic.\nStep 5: Rewrite your essay to improve it.\nStep 6: Go to Step 1.\n--------------------\nIf you do all of the above, you are going to definitely score well on your GRE.\nCheck out Magnus Prep\'s GRE Program if you are looking for some great mentors to help with your GRE preparation.\nCheers!', 'When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.\n\nNote: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.\n\n1. First Month: Conditioning\nAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don\'t have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nWork out (don\'t just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.\nIn parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well)\n\nFourth Week:\nTime for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don\'t forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)\nMeanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.\n\nSo, it\'s been one month now. Don\'t expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.\n\n2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull\'s Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way\nNow it\'s time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don\'t think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I\'m going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nSign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It\'s a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.\nJoin the New GRE group on Facebook. It\'s the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:\nMembers post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.\nSecondly, it\'s a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation.\nYou\'ll get access to some really USEFUL links.\nThe next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.\nThe last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don\'t forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.\nNow you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it\'s time for some real action !!\nFourth Week\nTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that\'s all its useful for. Don\'t expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms\n\n3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racer\n\nFirst Two Weeks\nPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don\'t leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don\'t, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn\'t take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I\'m telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.\n\nLast Two Weeks\nIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I\'d read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:\n\n20 online tests\n\n800Score\'s Free Full Length Revised GRE Test\n\nMyGRETutor\'s 4 free Full Length Tests\n\nKaplan\'s Free Practice Test Options for the GRE\n\nPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length test\n\nIts easy !

Although I started my preparation 3 months prior to the examination I could not continue due to the fact that I am also preparing for other competitive exams. Also I was put down by Chicken pox and Typhoid for a month. Effectively I had little more than a month to prepare for the test. So I was quite surprised with the result that I got as you can see above. Here is how I prepared for my GRE test.\nStudy Material -\nMagoosh GRE prep account (most important)\nMagoosh Vocabulary builder (words flashcard app)\nManhattan prep GRE 5 lb. book of gre practice problems\nManhattan GRE Prep Reading comprehension and Essay\nOfficial Guide for GRE by ETS (all three books)\nVarious news sites such as The New Yorker , The Economist etc. ( as prescribed on Magoosh GRE blog).\nStudy Plan -\nI started my preparation at the start of the month of July . As I told earlier I am also studying for other competitive exams so I could’nt devote much time to GRE. I studied for maximum 3 hours each day. I also did’nt study according to any plan. Some days it was only vocab building by flashcards and reading articles. Some days it was practicing problems Some days divided between both. Also I watched Magoosh GRE video lessons and I can say they were very useful.\nThis is a tip for students from engineering background preparing for GRE. Don’t ignore the quantitative section even if it seems easy to you. Practice it as you would the verbal section.\nAfter recovering from my maladies I had approx 5 weeks to prepare for GRE. So I decided to tidy up my routine so\nI increased my GRE study time to 5–6 hours per day\nIn a day I would first go through my magoosh flashcards and try to learn atleast 30 new words per day and also revise a few old words.

The below is inspired by the many sessions I’ve had with students, many of whom have gone on to do very well on the GRE. A lot of it is also specific to the revised GRE, which made its debut in August 2011.\n \n1. Use official material\n \nWhen preparing for the GRE, no questions prepare you better than the ones written by ETS, which is responsible for writing the questions you will see test day. As much as possible, stick to the questions in the Official Guide to the GRE so you can wrap your mind around how the test writers want you to reason.\n \nYou may not think that it makes that much of a difference, but many publishers out there have questions that require you to make certain leaps of logic—or employ questionable logic—that you will never have to do on the actual test.

This is a problem many students encounter when using Kaplan—you are essentially taking a dumbed down version of the GRE, with often poorly constructed questions to boot.\n \n\n2. Take practice tests\n \nThere is no better way to prepare for test day than actually taking a mock test. You will train yourself to sit for three plus hours staring at a screen, as you are pummeled by an onslaught of GRE problems.\n \nIf possible, use only the official tests, found in the Official Guide to the New GRE. There are four such tests—two that comes with the book, and two that are computer-based and come with the CD that is part of the book. Stagger these out  over the four weeks you are prepping, so that there are no fewer than five days between tests and no more than ten days. If you are studying longer, you might also want to consider Manhattan GRE tests (see below).\n \nFinally, practice tests will allow you to better assess your strengths and weaknesses, and help inform your study sessions in between tests.\n \n \n3. Focus on weaknesses\n \nMake sure not to get carried away developing those areas in which you already excel. For instance, if you are generally strong at math problem solving questions, but if you dislike Data Interpretation (that’s the section with all the graphs), then the last thing you want to do is avoid that section. Instead make it a priority to become confident and effective at all questions relating to Data Interpretation.\n \n \n4. Use the best material\n \nWhile official material is clearly the best prep out there, it doesn’t necessarily provide the most effective strategies. You may want to take a look at Princeton Review for helpful big picture strategies. As for specific strategies for almost every aspect of the GRE—from permutations to convoluted paragraph arguments—the Manhattan GRE books (MGRE) are the best. MGRE also has six practice tests that mimic the actual test very well (though this more so with math than with verbal). For more practice on the online format, Magoosh also offers questions that are similar to--and often more difficult--than those found on the actual test. (I should probably mention that I work for Magoosh :))\n \nOf course there is a lot of material out there that should be avoided, especially in terms of practice content.

How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,100+ Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I plan my preparation for the GRE?'],"['GRE has three main components namely verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing. Your entire preparation process should revolve around acquiring good skills on these areas and mastering the concepts required.\nSome of the things which you can do to get the required concept clarity are\nQuantitative reasoning:\nThe best part about GRE Math is the absence of things which most of us hate in Math - The integral calculus, trigonometry and other complicated stuff. GRE Math is mostly things which you learned in junior/ high school - Things like interger properties, word problems (rate of work, speed, probability etc) which can be solved with basic common sense. Not much beyond that.\nWhat makes the GRE so tricky is the interpretation of the questions part. Once you figure out what the question is asking, the math involved is definitely easier than what you faced in your high school. In fact, it is more fun as you don\'t need to write down each and every step and show your teacher on how you arrived at your answer. You just need to pick an answer. In short, the math section just tests your ability to reason with numbers.\nVerbal reasoning:\nVerbal reasoning section is even more simple with there being only 3 question types - text completion, critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The preparation process should be fully focused on knowing specific strategies for cracking these questions rather than generic preparation advocated.\nFor example, use of flash cards for learning new words was very helpful in the earlier format of the test where antonyms and analogies were asked and there was more emphasis on rote learning of words. But, the current format focuses more on understanding not only the literal meaning of the words but also the metaphorical use of the word based on the context. For example, while the word \'opaque\' literally means \'not transparent\', it could also mean \'difficult to interpret or understand\' if used in the right context. Similarly, there are no questions asking you to identify any grammar errors. Grammar is important only for your essay writing section. Hence, it makes sense not to rely on these old fashioned methods advocated by coaching institutes but to just keep focusing on the 3 question types.\nAnalytical writing:\nAnalytical writing section asks you to write 2 essays - one on ""The Issue"" and the other on ""The Argument"". The major difference here is in the first essay you are asked to take a stand on a complex issue whereas in the second essay you are asked to dissect the logic behind an already taken stand or position.\nHow do I prepare for this? You just need to follow a simple routine and you are guaranteed to score well in this section.\nChoose - Structure - Write - Compare - Improve - Choose\nStep 1: You choose a topic where you already have some well written sample essays. You can pick these up either in the official site or from the many blogs available online.\nStep 2: Come up with a structure and an outline.\nStep 3: Write an essay by developing the structure and the outline.\nStep 4: Compare it with other essays written on the topic.\nStep 5: Rewrite your essay to improve it.\nStep 6: Go to Step 1.\n--------------------\nIf you do all of the above, you are going to definitely score well on your GRE.\nCheck out Magnus Prep\'s GRE Program if you are looking for some great mentors to help with your GRE preparation.\nCheers!', 'When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.\n\nNote: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.\n\n1. First Month: Conditioning\nAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don\'t have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nWork out (don\'t just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.\nIn parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well)\n\nFourth Week:\nTime for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don\'t forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)\nMeanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.\n\nSo, it\'s been one month now. Don\'t expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.\n\n2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull\'s Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way\nNow it\'s time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don\'t think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I\'m going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nSign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It\'s a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.\nJoin the New GRE group on Facebook. It\'s the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:\nMembers post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.\nSecondly, it\'s a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation.\nYou\'ll get access to some really USEFUL links.\nThe next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.\nThe last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don\'t forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.\nNow you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it\'s time for some real action !!\nFourth Week\nTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that\'s all its useful for. Don\'t expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms\n\n3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racer\n\nFirst Two Weeks\nPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don\'t leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don\'t, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn\'t take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I\'m telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.\n\nLast Two Weeks\nIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I\'d read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:\n\n20 online tests\n\n800Score\'s Free Full Length Revised GRE Test\n\nMyGRETutor\'s 4 free Full Length Tests\n\nKaplan\'s Free Practice Test Options for the GRE\n\nPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length test\n\nIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!\n\nOriginally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?', 'Quant - 170 Verbal- 164 AWA- 4.5/6\nI recently gave my GRE on 28th September 2017. Although I started my preparation 3 months prior to the examination I could not continue due to the fact that I am also preparing for other competitive exams. Also I was put down by Chicken pox and Typhoid for a month. Effectively I had little more than a month to prepare for the test.

As I told earlier I am also studying for other competitive exams so I could’nt devote much time to GRE. I studied for maximum 3 hours each day. I also did’nt study according to any plan. Some days it was only vocab building by flashcards and reading articles. Some days it was practicing problems Some days divided between both. Also I watched Magoosh GRE video lessons and I can say they were very useful.\nThis is a tip for students from engineering background preparing for GRE. Don’t ignore the quantitative section even if it seems easy to you. Practice it as you would the verbal section.\nAfter recovering from my maladies I had approx 5 weeks to prepare for GRE. So I decided to tidy up my routine so\nI increased my GRE study time to 5–6 hours per day\nIn a day I would first go through my magoosh flashcards and try to learn atleast 30 new words per day and also revise a few old words.

How do I score 320 in GRE in 20 days?,17 Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nHow do I score 320 in GRE in 20 days?'],"[""Making time would be your biggest concern so you will have to make time everyday or squeeze it into your busy schedule. You need to know the following about the GRE exam before you start your preparation.\nThe GRE exam has 3 sections the analytical writing section, the verbal section and the quants section.\nThe analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to your GRE score so you needn’t break your head about it.\nThe Quants and verbal section are for 170 marks each. The quants is the scoring section and you should ideally be looking to get 170/170 in this section. Anything more than 160 is a great score when it comes to verbal.\nYou are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 minutes in each of these sections.\nSomething that most of the people don’t know is that the GRE is actually only for 80 marks but the marks are awarded out of 320 so that we don’t assume that a person who scores a 40 is only half as good as a person who scores 80 so the scores are given on a scale of 260–340.\nYou needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.\nGetting to the hardest part of it all PREPARATION:\nYou needn’t prepare for hours together to crack the GRE.\nMost people find the Quants section easy so you should just be trying to brush up on your basic concepts. I would suggest you make your concepts concrete and don’t get carried away in cramming as many formulas as possible. Once you’re confident enough try taking up a mock test and see where you stand, analyze your mistakes and then go back to those topics and make sure that there isn’t an Achilles heel. Spend as little time as possible preparing for Quants and I don’t think it will take up a lot of time. 1 hour a day for a month and you should be good to go.\nThe dicey section is the verbal section and it will definitely be the make or mar factor in your GRE since you may not be accustomed to the language used. The best way to prepare for the verbal section is to READ. The verbal section is predominantly vocabulary based and being thorough with vocabulary might just make the difference between you getting into an average institute or premier institute abroad.\nPlease try to stick to the following schedule:\nSpend two hours each day for the verbal section of GRE and one hour for the Quants section.\nMake sure that your preparation doesn't take a back seat during the weekends or due to some occasion like a friend's birthday.\nGRE Quants in a week:\nPeople are usually comfortable with the Quants section. If you are from an engineering or science background, you are already leaps and bounds ahead of your peers.\n1.Brush up your concepts and make sure you don’t get carried away and cram as many formulas as you can.\n2. Make sure that you approach each problem logically .\n3. Cover all the bases and make sure to go through each topic since Quants is a scoring section and you should ideally be aiming for 170/170 and nothing else.\n4. Practice each type of question and double check the concepts from high school that you never really understood but chose to skip anyway :P\n5. Be stubborn and don’t proceed until you get it right.\nCheck out the best self study partner for cracking the GRE Quants section. I am pretty sure you will find this useful.\nGRE verbal in 10 days:\nGRE is predominantly a vocabulary based section. The quants section of the GRE isn’t very hard to crack and the analytical writing section doesn’t contribute to you GRE score. The verbal section will generally be the make or mar factor in your GRE and will make the difference between you getting into a premier institute or average institute abroad. If you are from an English medium school you would already be strong with your basics which makes it all the more easy for you to prepare yourself. Being thorough with the high frequency words can actually help you a lot. Check out the Barron’s 333.\nThere are very few types of questions in the verbal section like text completion, sentence correction, reading comprehension and critical reasoning. I highly recommend the GRE verbal prep: A definitive guide. It is probably the best study material for a quick preparation. There are loads of practice questions and tests that are available along with videos which will definitely help you remember the words and their in-context meaning. Several shortcuts, tips and mnemonics are also a part of the videos. When you connect things with pictures, you remember them better which is exactly what the videos do. The etymology of the words are also dealt with in detail so that you can understand how a word came into existence and how it has evolved over the years.\nThe MOCK frenzy with an error log:\nYou still have a few days left. You should be taking up as many mock tests as possible. Go CRAZY!\nKeep solving questions and analyzing them.\nKeep a check on your progress.\nIdentify the topics which aren’t really comfortable with. They may turn out to be the Achilles Heel on the day of the exam so don’t leave anything to chance.\nThere is no point in solving umpteen number of problems from topics which are your strong suit. Solve more problems related to the topic which you aren’t comfortable with\nSolve → Analyze → Identify errors → solve more → Repeat\nOn the day before the exam JUST CHILL. Stop learning and don’t learn anything new since it is more likely that you will get confused because of it. Brush up on the concepts and KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK!\nA few of the following tips may come in handy:\nThe GRE is a timed test: If we had all the time we need, then every one of us would get the perfect score on the GRE. But the GRE is a timed test, so it is important to not only be accurate but also quick when it comes to answering the questions. So when preparing for the GRE, time yourself. You are expected to answer 20 questions in 30 mins both in the Verbal and the Quants section. Attempt a lot of mock tests it will help you a lot.\nBe aware of the wrong answers:\nThe wrong answers generally tend to fall under certain categories which will help you eliminate the wrong choices when it comes to the GRE verbal reasoning section or reading comprehensions.\nThe choices are most probably wrong if they:\nAssume too much\nAre beyond the scope of the passage\nAre too extreme\nAre true but involve outside knowledge\nAre too specific/too broad\nSave the worst for the last:\nThey usually say save the best for the last but it doesn’t hold good when it comes to the competitive exams like GRE. You will end up wasting time if you attempt the unfamiliar questions. If you find a question complex, it is better to leave it for the time being and improve your score by answering the questions related to the easier and familiar questions.\nUtilize the scratch pad:\nTake short notes while reading the comprehension passage in the space allotted. Eliminate the unnecessary details and words which are just present to throw you off.\nThe following are a few tips that might come in handy when it comes to the reading comprehension but they might also be applied to any question in the verbal section.\nDUMB them down:\nQuestions on reading comprehension passages have the most gray area when compared to any other type of question in the GRE.\nAvoid skimming through the questions without understanding what is specifically being asked. If you find a question or choice confusing rephrase the question in your one words.\nBe on the look out for concessions:\nIn many cases, the author may have a strong voice towards a certain topic or aspect in the passages. The author might have a strong opinion towards certain aspects in a passage and argue for it throughout the passage but then the author might suddenly stop doing so and make subtle or drastic concessions to the opposing side which will weaken the arguments that were previously made in the reading comprehension passage. Make sure that you aren’t thrown by such concessions.\nMake use of the context:\nIf the question asked is related to a specific line in the reading comprehension passage, it won’t help if you just go back and read the sentence. The thumb rule is to read at least one sentence before and after the aforementioned line.\nZero in on the idea behind the longer passages:\nMajority of the reading comprehension passages that you will come across while taking the GRE will be short but on the off chance that you encounter one or two longer ones, it is advisable to focus more on the first and last paragraphs of the passage and find the big picture of the passage, since time is of the essence.\nFind the tone of the passage:\nThe tone of the passage can be found using the choice of words or the turn of phrases used by the author. Even if the tone appears to be neutral, assume that it is complex and look for the tone. You can arrive at the tone by observing the diction or by asking the following questions:\nDoes the author feel positively or negatively about a certain topic?\nWhat aspect of the topic does the author criticize?\nWhat concerns does the author raise through the passage?\nWhich adverbs and adjectives does the author use to voice his opinion?\nLast but not the least\nWatch your diet: An important factor which most students ignore to their detriment is their health and diet. This is very important both during your preparation and while taking the test. Ensure that you stick to a nutritious diet since you will need a lot of energy during your preparation. It is a good thing to avoid eating outside especially junk food, during your preparatory phase. Also, refrain from drinking, partying and taking recreational drugs a week or two before the Test day.\nP.S.

However, I started with a good foundation. With my SAT history and intense workload at college, I scored 320+ on my first mock test after I reviewed the vocabulary — in other words, it took me nothing but memorizing a few words to get myself at around 320.\nPeople at different levels or from different backgrounds require different strategies and time investment to reach that 320 goal. Regardless, the 20 days I spent got me 15+ points further. I can’t tell you how to reach 320 without knowing much about your background and needs, but I can tell you how to utilize a shorter time period to make some good progress:\nFocus. The famous 80/20 Rule states that roughly 80% of your outcomes come from 20% of your inputs.[1] This applies to GRE as well. There will be areas on GRE where you can most quickly improve. When the time is limited, you need to focus on those areas to make the most progress. Take a few mock tests and find those spots, and work on them relentlessly.\nMake mistakes. Don’t worry about them at all. It is a good thing to find yourself making mistakes when you’re practicing than you do on the real test. When you practice, you want to expose all the possible ways you make mistakes, and then find ways to avoid them. The reality is, aside from the vocabulary, GRE hardly covers anything that esoteric. In many cases, it’s the silly mistakes you make that really keeps you from getting your dream score. Learning how to avoid those mistakes can allow you to improve quickly. You just need to identify them first, by making them.\nAnalyze. Don’t just practice questions after questions. Think about them. Find patterns, find how you get them wrong, and find quicker ways to solve these questions. At the end of the day, it’s not the quantity of questions that you practiced on that matters the most, it’s how you treat them. Don’t just focus on getting the questions right, focus on how to get better.\nConsolidate. After you’ve practiced, made mistakes, and analyzed them, now it’s time to consolidate your takeaways. Make yourself a list of actions you can take during the actual test to help yourself perform better. This could include double checking your zeros, or being more alarmed of particular words, or things you tend to forget or overlook. Take a good look at them before you take the test.\nMany of my friends have asked me how I got the score I have. Frankly this is it. Now I’m building Gregory to help people do these things automatically. I’d be happy to hear any thoughts/feedback on it.\nFootnotes\n[1] What Is The 80/20 Rule And Why It Will Change Your Life', '20 Days - it is a really small amount for preparation, but you can manage it.

It is designed for those with only 2 weeks or more to prepare with strategies and tips you need to prepare FAST.\nHere is a schedule guide in Mastering Words for you:\nI am using the SMART Objective way in helping me prepare for any exam. Identifying the SMART Objective of your GRE Preparation would somehow look like this:\nS - Specific: Your end-goal should be stated, for example: Be confident when taking the GRE exam because I have prepared very well, studied every topic and even had practice tests to enhance more my skills. It should include the “W” questions: Who? What? Where? When? Which? and Why?\nM - Measurable: A proper schedule should be created and maintained. Establish a concrete number - how many number of words would you like to master? How many weeks would you like to spend for each GRE section? How will I determine if I have accomplished it?\nA - Achievable: A schedule with defined time and activity is something needed for preparation. Make sure that the words you wanted to master and the time you want to prepare would be achievable. Also, practice as many mock test as possible to avoid cram during exam.\nR - Realistic: Provide each list of words a realistic time to finish. Let’s say a list of 10 words can be mastered in 3 days or maybe a week. That includes reviewing it through games/the help of vocab app. I suggest you use Preped Vocab - for free. (But that depends on you)\nT - Time-based: Schedule, schedule, schedule. :)\nFor more help, we have asked a couple of GRE tutors and authors with the following questions.

(Quantitative Section)\nHelpful Tips For Anyone Interested In Taking The GRE\nAre Practice Tests Harder Than The Actual Test For GMAT or GRE?', ""It's doable, but I gotta say, it's really really hard. GRE is designed to test your accumulated knowledge and not meant for last minute crammers. Here's some things you can do.\nYou simply don't have the time to significantly improve your vocabulary. But the good news is, even with an average vocabulary, achieving a verbal score above 155 is feasible. But do make sure to familiarize yourself with Barron's 333 high frequency words.\nReading comprehension questions are the most tricky questions in the GRE. Devote some time to regularly practice these questions and check the answer explanations. Search and watch for Magoosh's videos on RC questions as well as other types of questions to help you out.\nMost people suggest Manhattan and Barron's series for quant and verbal prep and they are probably right. Since I had an engineering background, quant was never a problem for me. My only suggestion for quant, PRACTICE.\nETS quant questions have some really well hidden traps and even the most adept candidates fall prey to these traps. So read every question correctly. It's not rocket science, just keen observation. Again, keep practicing to remove silly mistakes.\nBe sure to reserve the last 6-7 days for full GRE practice. It's not easy to stay focussed, and keep looking at a computer screen for four hours straight, and keep your mind sharp in the process. Only practice will make you get used to the strain.\nWhile taking the full tests, work on your timing and pacing. You might discover a strategy that works best for you. For example, may be you find geometry questions easy and solving them first will leave you more time for the rest of the questions. Same goes for the verbal.\nFor the awa section (which cannot be taken for granted BTW), I suggest to first go through the ETS official guide, and then magoosh videos to get an idea of the general template.\nThere is only one way of acing the GRE: practice. Spend the first 9-11 days familiarizing with the exam pattern and the type of questions and devote the rest for practicing. I wish you all the best for your exam. Best of luck.""]"
How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,100+ Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I plan my preparation for the GRE?'],"['GRE has three main components namely verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing. Your entire preparation process should revolve around acquiring good skills on these areas and mastering the concepts required.\nSome of the things which you can do to get the required concept clarity are\nQuantitative reasoning:\nThe best part about GRE Math is the absence of things which most of us hate in Math - The integral calculus, trigonometry and other complicated stuff. GRE Math is mostly things which you learned in junior/ high school - Things like interger properties, word problems (rate of work, speed, probability etc) which can be solved with basic common sense. Not much beyond that.\nWhat makes the GRE so tricky is the interpretation of the questions part. Once you figure out what the question is asking, the math involved is definitely easier than what you faced in your high school. In fact, it is more fun as you don\'t need to write down each and every step and show your teacher on how you arrived at your answer. You just need to pick an answer. In short, the math section just tests your ability to reason with numbers.\nVerbal reasoning:\nVerbal reasoning section is even more simple with there being only 3 question types - text completion, critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The preparation process should be fully focused on knowing specific strategies for cracking these questions rather than generic preparation advocated.\nFor example, use of flash cards for learning new words was very helpful in the earlier format of the test where antonyms and analogies were asked and there was more emphasis on rote learning of words. But, the current format focuses more on understanding not only the literal meaning of the words but also the metaphorical use of the word based on the context. For example, while the word \'opaque\' literally means \'not transparent\', it could also mean \'difficult to interpret or understand\' if used in the right context. Similarly, there are no questions asking you to identify any grammar errors. Grammar is important only for your essay writing section. Hence, it makes sense not to rely on these old fashioned methods advocated by coaching institutes but to just keep focusing on the 3 question types.\nAnalytical writing:\nAnalytical writing section asks you to write 2 essays - one on ""The Issue"" and the other on ""The Argument"". The major difference here is in the first essay you are asked to take a stand on a complex issue whereas in the second essay you are asked to dissect the logic behind an already taken stand or position.\nHow do I prepare for this? You just need to follow a simple routine and you are guaranteed to score well in this section.\nChoose - Structure - Write - Compare - Improve - Choose\nStep 1: You choose a topic where you already have some well written sample essays. You can pick these up either in the official site or from the many blogs available online.\nStep 2: Come up with a structure and an outline.\nStep 3: Write an essay by developing the structure and the outline.\nStep 4: Compare it with other essays written on the topic.\nStep 5: Rewrite your essay to improve it.\nStep 6: Go to Step 1.\n--------------------\nIf you do all of the above, you are going to definitely score well on your GRE.\nCheck out Magnus Prep\'s GRE Program if you are looking for some great mentors to help with your GRE preparation.\nCheers!', 'When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.\n\nNote: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.\n\n1. First Month: Conditioning\nAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don\'t have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nWork out (don\'t just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.\nIn parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well)\n\nFourth Week:\nTime for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don\'t forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)\nMeanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.\n\nSo, it\'s been one month now. Don\'t expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.\n\n2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull\'s Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way\nNow it\'s time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don\'t think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I\'m going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nSign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It\'s a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.\nJoin the New GRE group on Facebook. It\'s the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:\nMembers post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.\nSecondly, it\'s a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation.\nYou\'ll get access to some really USEFUL links.\nThe next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.\nThe last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don\'t forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.\nNow you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it\'s time for some real action !!\nFourth Week\nTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that\'s all its useful for. Don\'t expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms\n\n3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racer\n\nFirst Two Weeks\nPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don\'t leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don\'t, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn\'t take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I\'m telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.\n\nLast Two Weeks\nIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I\'d read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:\n\n20 online tests\n\n800Score\'s Free Full Length Revised GRE Test\n\nMyGRETutor\'s 4 free Full Length Tests\n\nKaplan\'s Free Practice Test Options for the GRE\n\nPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length test\n\nIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!\n\nOriginally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?', 'Quant - 170 Verbal- 164 AWA- 4.5/6\nI recently gave my GRE on 28th September 2017. Although I started my preparation 3 months prior to the examination I could not continue due to the fact that I am also preparing for other competitive exams. Also I was put down by Chicken pox and Typhoid for a month. Effectively I had little more than a month to prepare for the test. So I was quite surprised with the result that I got as you can see above. Here is how I prepared for my GRE test.\nStudy Material -\nMagoosh GRE prep account (most important)\nMagoosh Vocabulary builder (words flashcard app)\nManhattan prep GRE 5 lb. book of gre practice problems\nManhattan GRE Prep Reading comprehension and Essay\nOfficial Guide for GRE by ETS (all three books)\nVarious news sites such as The New Yorker , The Economist etc. ( as prescribed on Magoosh GRE blog).\nStudy Plan -\nI started my preparation at the start of the month of July . As I told earlier I am also studying for other competitive exams so I could’nt devote much time to GRE. I studied for maximum 3 hours each day. I also did’nt study according to any plan. Some days it was only vocab building by flashcards and reading articles. Some days it was practicing problems Some days divided between both. Also I watched Magoosh GRE video lessons and I can say they were very useful.\nThis is a tip for students from engineering background preparing for GRE. Don’t ignore the quantitative section even if it seems easy to you. Practice it as you would the verbal section.\nAfter recovering from my maladies I had approx 5 weeks to prepare for GRE. So I decided to tidy up my routine so\nI increased my GRE study time to 5–6 hours per day\nIn a day I would first go through my magoosh flashcards and try to learn atleast 30 new words per day and also revise a few old words. Also I made a point to read and understand atleast 2 news articles per day .\nThen I would practice quantitative for approx 1 hour . I generally used timed custom practice test in Magoosh GRE account.\nFor next 2 hours I would go through practicing the verbal section and writing essays.\nI learnt how to read the paragraphs swiftly and in detail. Again Magoosh video lessons were very important in this regard.\nUnfortunately I was not able to give any full practice test due to my surroundings but I would recommend everyone to give atleast one of them.\nMy main focus was on improving my vocab by learning new words , their meaning and context of their uses as it appeared to me to be very useful for Sentence equivalence and Text completion questions. Again and I cannot stress this enough watching Magoosh video lessons was very important.\nI practiced and practiced as much as my schedule allowed me to.\nOn the day of the examination\nReach the centre atleast 1 hour prior to the commencement of test as there are plenty of verification to be done before the examination. Also carry a water bottle with you. GRE is very attentively conducted examination and staff of testing centres are very vigilant. If you have any problem feel free to ask for their help.\nGRE is a very easy exam as you can see in my case , with a directed and concentrated approach you can score very well ( 330+) within a relatively short amount of prep time.\nBe well , Be prepared and best of luck.', 'I’ve been tutoring the GRE for a number of years. The below is inspired by the many sessions I’ve had with students, many of whom have gone on to do very well on the GRE. A lot of it is also specific to the revised GRE, which made its debut in August 2011.\n \n1. Use official material\n \nWhen preparing for the GRE, no questions prepare you better than the ones written by ETS, which is responsible for writing the questions you will see test day. As much as possible, stick to the questions in the Official Guide to the GRE so you can wrap your mind around how the test writers want you to reason.\n \nYou may not think that it makes that much of a difference, but many publishers out there have questions that require you to make certain leaps of logic—or employ questionable logic—that you will never have to do on the actual test. Then there is the fact that many questions simply aren’t as difficult or nuanced as the questions you’ll see test day. This is a problem many students encounter when using Kaplan—you are essentially taking a dumbed down version of the GRE, with often poorly constructed questions to boot.\n \n\n2. Take practice tests\n \nThere is no better way to prepare for test day than actually taking a mock test. You will train yourself to sit for three plus hours staring at a screen, as you are pummeled by an onslaught of GRE problems.\n \nIf possible, use only the official tests, found in the Official Guide to the New GRE. There are four such tests—two that comes with the book, and two that are computer-based and come with the CD that is part of the book. Stagger these out  over the four weeks you are prepping, so that there are no fewer than five days between tests and no more than ten days. If you are studying longer, you might also want to consider Manhattan GRE tests (see below).\n \nFinally, practice tests will allow you to better assess your strengths and weaknesses, and help inform your study sessions in between tests.\n \n \n3. Focus on weaknesses\n \nMake sure not to get carried away developing those areas in which you already excel. For instance, if you are generally strong at math problem solving questions, but if you dislike Data Interpretation (that’s the section with all the graphs), then the last thing you want to do is avoid that section. Instead make it a priority to become confident and effective at all questions relating to Data Interpretation.\n \n \n4. Use the best material\n \nWhile official material is clearly the best prep out there, it doesn’t necessarily provide the most effective strategies. You may want to take a look at Princeton Review for helpful big picture strategies. As for specific strategies for almost every aspect of the GRE—from permutations to convoluted paragraph arguments—the Manhattan GRE books (MGRE) are the best. MGRE also has six practice tests that mimic the actual test very well (though this more so with math than with verbal). For more practice on the online format, Magoosh also offers questions that are similar to--and often more difficult--than those found on the actual test. (I should probably mention that I work for Magoosh :))\n \nOf course there is a lot of material out there that should be avoided, especially in terms of practice content.

How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,100+ Answers,['Freelancers\nFreelance Tips and Hacks\nFreelancing\nHow do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?'],"['A freelancer\'s guide to taking over the world!\nEstablish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.\nEducate yourself:It\'s a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.\nGet organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn\'t have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.\nAnother thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.\nKnow your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.\nManage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.\nMy suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.\nThe golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - Expenditure\nGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.\nMarket your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It\'s ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!\nYou could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your terms\nKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!\n- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms', 'It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.\nYou’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements. You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.\nYou’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.\nYou have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it.\n You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door. But, remember ‘freelancing job is also an actual job’. There’s nothing fancy about it until you make it.\nBefore you are a freelancer you should prepare for being one. These is a simple road-map which you need to follow with determination, to make through this challenge.\nACQUIRING SKILLS:\nThis is the most important part. You need to acquire skills in whatever field you choose. You may find this boring and have an urge to jump over and look up to the offers. You may have misconceptions of having all necessary skills. But, this is the only way you can be successful in long run.\nTake a break to start an elaborated research in the chosen field and the specializations they demand.\nLook out for dummy projects to build a great portfolio. Offer to work with your peers, friends and nonprofit organizations for free.\nKeep a close look at people already in the industry and look up to their work. Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.\nMANAGING NETWORKS\nLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department. Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.\nNow that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.\nBEING THE BRAND\nThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.\nYou need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out. Make sure they’re aware of what you’re offering and what’s special about it. You need to update all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora etc accordingly. Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help. Get your business cards and be ready to talk about the work you do and yourself more often.\nLearn some basic marketing and accounting skills. Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.\nTHE ADVENTURE RIDE\nNow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!\nStart looking out for jobs. This might be a slow-moving process, instead of getting stressed introspect your offers.\nAt first work on project/job expecting limited or no money at all. This is to just make connection sharpening your skills and showcasing your talent. These resources might be helpful to start off: Upwork, Guru, Elance, PeoplePerHour, Freelancer, Craig list;\nOnce you have built a quality portfolio and demonstrated your work it’s time to hunt big offers. Serve the clients with generosity, build a rapport. Businesses will start taking you seriously about your specialization.\nYour career will see a boost. In the long run, you can either be choosy about your project or take projects in volumes, both are keys to success. With time, you’ll be able to create a Brand which clients and businesses will look up to.\nFinally, keep up the good work and regularly meet other freelancers, talk them about your business. Use calling more often than emailing to a client. These things will give your brand a personal touch and also avoid the feeling of isolation. Now, you are independent and can set your own working ethics being selective about projects and jobs. The best thing is you can take a break whenever you want and use the time to develop or acquire new skills. Ultimately, it’s an adventure trip where you decide your path and enjoy it. So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.\nThis answer is a part of my blog, read it here.\nIf you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.\nPlease do let me know your suggestions and feedback.\nI’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.', 'Let’s start step by step:\n1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.\nIf you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:\nFreelancer - Hire & Find Jobs\nUpwork\nCraigslist\nPeoplePerHour\n99designs\nGuru\nEngineerBabu\nHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.\n2. Build a Perfect website\nAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.\nWhile building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:\n20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.\nShow diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.\nInclude your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.\nIf you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.\n3. Brand Yourself\nOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-\nWhether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.\nAlong with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.\nYour logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.\nMost importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.\nThe domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.\nBecome a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.\n4. Understand the project requirement carefully\nAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:\nThe work that client is offering you is his/her dream.\nYour client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.\nBe reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.\nThe client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.\nDon’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.\nAlways give very clear and genuine project timeline.\nUnderstand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.\nNote down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.\nNever steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.\nAll the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.\n5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own services\nOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.\nThere are three different strategies that can be opted for are-\nCost-plus pricing\nYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.\nMarket Rate pricing\nBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.\nValue driven pricing\nIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.\n6. Timely Communication with Clients\nCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.\n7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadline\nBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.\nSince you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.\n8. Always deliver more than Expected\nLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”\nKeeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.\nThe only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.\n9. Be Professional\nWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-\nStarting date of project\nThe project’s deadline\nMilestones\nFunctionalities\nSchedule meeting in prior\nMake the clear timeline of deliverables.\nProfessionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–\nKeep Your Personal Life limited to yourself\nYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.\n It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.\nCharge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.\nSchedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.\nIf some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.\nBuild the right association.\nIt is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.\nFollow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.\nDon’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.\nBe positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.\n10. Networking and Relationship with Clients\nBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..\nSome useful techniques to grow your network.\n1. Increase your Social Media Network\n Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.\n 2. Attend events\n You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.\n3. Speak at events\n Better than attending events become a speaker at one or two. Speaking at such events increases your credibility networking opportunities and hence you will be more visible than other fellows present in the event.\n 4. Connect with ex-colleagues and ex-clients\n Keep in touch with your college colleagues and clients will help you in getting new work from them. Since they know what you are Good at.\n 5. Connect at co-working space\n You can share your desk with other freelancers from another field; this is the best way to enrich knowledge and network.\n All points listed above reinforces you to become a freelancer, your perfect profile generation for freelance success and helps you in becoming your own boss with a promising career ahead.', 'For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.\nThat doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.\nBut I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.\nFor example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:\n“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”\nTo that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.\nOf course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.\nHere are a few:\nYou learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.\nThere are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.\nIt’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.\nYou get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?\nFreelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.\nBottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.\nAnd you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.\nIf you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.\nOn the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.\nOnce you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.']"
How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,100+ Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I plan my preparation for the GRE?'],"['GRE has three main components namely verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing. Your entire preparation process should revolve around acquiring good skills on these areas and mastering the concepts required.\nSome of the things which you can do to get the required concept clarity are\nQuantitative reasoning:\nThe best part about GRE Math is the absence of things which most of us hate in Math - The integral calculus, trigonometry and other complicated stuff. GRE Math is mostly things which you learned in junior/ high school - Things like interger properties, word problems (rate of work, speed, probability etc) which can be solved with basic common sense. Not much beyond that.\nWhat makes the GRE so tricky is the interpretation of the questions part. Once you figure out what the question is asking, the math involved is definitely easier than what you faced in your high school. In fact, it is more fun as you don\'t need to write down each and every step and show your teacher on how you arrived at your answer. You just need to pick an answer. In short, the math section just tests your ability to reason with numbers.\nVerbal reasoning:\nVerbal reasoning section is even more simple with there being only 3 question types - text completion, critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The preparation process should be fully focused on knowing specific strategies for cracking these questions rather than generic preparation advocated.\nFor example, use of flash cards for learning new words was very helpful in the earlier format of the test where antonyms and analogies were asked and there was more emphasis on rote learning of words. But, the current format focuses more on understanding not only the literal meaning of the words but also the metaphorical use of the word based on the context. For example, while the word \'opaque\' literally means \'not transparent\', it could also mean \'difficult to interpret or understand\' if used in the right context. Similarly, there are no questions asking you to identify any grammar errors. Grammar is important only for your essay writing section. Hence, it makes sense not to rely on these old fashioned methods advocated by coaching institutes but to just keep focusing on the 3 question types.\nAnalytical writing:\nAnalytical writing section asks you to write 2 essays - one on ""The Issue"" and the other on ""The Argument"". The major difference here is in the first essay you are asked to take a stand on a complex issue whereas in the second essay you are asked to dissect the logic behind an already taken stand or position.\nHow do I prepare for this? You just need to follow a simple routine and you are guaranteed to score well in this section.\nChoose - Structure - Write - Compare - Improve - Choose\nStep 1: You choose a topic where you already have some well written sample essays. You can pick these up either in the official site or from the many blogs available online.\nStep 2: Come up with a structure and an outline.\nStep 3: Write an essay by developing the structure and the outline.\nStep 4: Compare it with other essays written on the topic.\nStep 5: Rewrite your essay to improve it.\nStep 6: Go to Step 1.\n--------------------\nIf you do all of the above, you are going to definitely score well on your GRE.\nCheck out Magnus Prep\'s GRE Program if you are looking for some great mentors to help with your GRE preparation.\nCheers!', 'When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.\n\nNote: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.\n\n1. First Month: Conditioning\nAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don\'t have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nWork out (don\'t just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.\nIn parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well)\n\nFourth Week:\nTime for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don\'t forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)\nMeanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.\n\nSo, it\'s been one month now. Don\'t expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.\n\n2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull\'s Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way\nNow it\'s time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don\'t think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I\'m going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nSign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It\'s a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.\nJoin the New GRE group on Facebook. It\'s the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:\nMembers post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.\nSecondly, it\'s a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation.\nYou\'ll get access to some really USEFUL links.\nThe next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.\nThe last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don\'t forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.\nNow you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it\'s time for some real action !!\nFourth Week\nTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that\'s all its useful for. Don\'t expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms\n\n3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racer\n\nFirst Two Weeks\nPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don\'t leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don\'t, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn\'t take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I\'m telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.\n\nLast Two Weeks\nIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I\'d read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:\n\n20 online tests\n\n800Score\'s Free Full Length Revised GRE Test\n\nMyGRETutor\'s 4 free Full Length Tests\n\nKaplan\'s Free Practice Test Options for the GRE\n\nPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length test\n\nIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!\n\nOriginally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?', 'Quant - 170 Verbal- 164 AWA- 4.5/6\nI recently gave my GRE on 28th September 2017. Although I started my preparation 3 months prior to the examination I could not continue due to the fact that I am also preparing for other competitive exams. Also I was put down by Chicken pox and Typhoid for a month. Effectively I had little more than a month to prepare for the test. So I was quite surprised with the result that I got as you can see above. Here is how I prepared for my GRE test.\nStudy Material -\nMagoosh GRE prep account (most important)\nMagoosh Vocabulary builder (words flashcard app)\nManhattan prep GRE 5 lb. book of gre practice problems\nManhattan GRE Prep Reading comprehension and Essay\nOfficial Guide for GRE by ETS (all three books)\nVarious news sites such as The New Yorker , The Economist etc. ( as prescribed on Magoosh GRE blog).\nStudy Plan -\nI started my preparation at the start of the month of July . As I told earlier I am also studying for other competitive exams so I could’nt devote much time to GRE. I studied for maximum 3 hours each day. I also did’nt study according to any plan. Some days it was only vocab building by flashcards and reading articles. Some days it was practicing problems Some days divided between both. Also I watched Magoosh GRE video lessons and I can say they were very useful.\nThis is a tip for students from engineering background preparing for GRE. Don’t ignore the quantitative section even if it seems easy to you. Practice it as you would the verbal section.\nAfter recovering from my maladies I had approx 5 weeks to prepare for GRE. So I decided to tidy up my routine so\nI increased my GRE study time to 5–6 hours per day\nIn a day I would first go through my magoosh flashcards and try to learn atleast 30 new words per day and also revise a few old words. Also I made a point to read and understand atleast 2 news articles per day .\nThen I would practice quantitative for approx 1 hour . I generally used timed custom practice test in Magoosh GRE account.\nFor next 2 hours I would go through practicing the verbal section and writing essays.\nI learnt how to read the paragraphs swiftly and in detail. Again Magoosh video lessons were very important in this regard.\nUnfortunately I was not able to give any full practice test due to my surroundings but I would recommend everyone to give atleast one of them.\nMy main focus was on improving my vocab by learning new words , their meaning and context of their uses as it appeared to me to be very useful for Sentence equivalence and Text completion questions. Again and I cannot stress this enough watching Magoosh video lessons was very important.\nI practiced and practiced as much as my schedule allowed me to.\nOn the day of the examination\nReach the centre atleast 1 hour prior to the commencement of test as there are plenty of verification to be done before the examination. Also carry a water bottle with you. GRE is very attentively conducted examination and staff of testing centres are very vigilant. If you have any problem feel free to ask for their help.\nGRE is a very easy exam as you can see in my case , with a directed and concentrated approach you can score very well ( 330+) within a relatively short amount of prep time.\nBe well , Be prepared and best of luck.', 'I’ve been tutoring the GRE for a number of years. The below is inspired by the many sessions I’ve had with students, many of whom have gone on to do very well on the GRE. A lot of it is also specific to the revised GRE, which made its debut in August 2011.\n \n1. Use official material\n \nWhen preparing for the GRE, no questions prepare you better than the ones written by ETS, which is responsible for writing the questions you will see test day. As much as possible, stick to the questions in the Official Guide to the GRE so you can wrap your mind around how the test writers want you to reason.\n \nYou may not think that it makes that much of a difference, but many publishers out there have questions that require you to make certain leaps of logic—or employ questionable logic—that you will never have to do on the actual test. Then there is the fact that many questions simply aren’t as difficult or nuanced as the questions you’ll see test day. This is a problem many students encounter when using Kaplan—you are essentially taking a dumbed down version of the GRE, with often poorly constructed questions to boot.\n \n\n2. Take practice tests\n \nThere is no better way to prepare for test day than actually taking a mock test. You will train yourself to sit for three plus hours staring at a screen, as you are pummeled by an onslaught of GRE problems.\n \nIf possible, use only the official tests, found in the Official Guide to the New GRE. There are four such tests—two that comes with the book, and two that are computer-based and come with the CD that is part of the book. Stagger these out  over the four weeks you are prepping, so that there are no fewer than five days between tests and no more than ten days. If you are studying longer, you might also want to consider Manhattan GRE tests (see below).\n \nFinally, practice tests will allow you to better assess your strengths and weaknesses, and help inform your study sessions in between tests.\n \n \n3. Focus on weaknesses\n \nMake sure not to get carried away developing those areas in which you already excel. For instance, if you are generally strong at math problem solving questions, but if you dislike Data Interpretation (that’s the section with all the graphs), then the last thing you want to do is avoid that section. Instead make it a priority to become confident and effective at all questions relating to Data Interpretation.\n \n \n4. Use the best material\n \nWhile official material is clearly the best prep out there, it doesn’t necessarily provide the most effective strategies. You may want to take a look at Princeton Review for helpful big picture strategies. As for specific strategies for almost every aspect of the GRE—from permutations to convoluted paragraph arguments—the Manhattan GRE books (MGRE) are the best. MGRE also has six practice tests that mimic the actual test very well (though this more so with math than with verbal). For more practice on the online format, Magoosh also offers questions that are similar to--and often more difficult--than those found on the actual test. (I should probably mention that I work for Magoosh :))\n \nOf course there is a lot of material out there that should be avoided, especially in terms of practice content.

The prospect of moving to a strange country, meeting new friends and living independently cannot fail to excite anyone. It really comes as no surprise, then, that the Ministry of External Affairs reported that as many as 7.5 lakh Indian students are studying abroad in 2018, with the numbers only predicted to rise in the coming years.\nWith the US and Canada retaining top spots as the preferred study abroad destinations, (with 2.1 lakh and 1 lakh Indian students respectively) it goes without saying, then, that the competition for seats at universities in these two countries can get incredibly stiff.\neBook Download: USA or Canada - What’s the right choice for MS\nAdd to that the high costs of application fees, and it becomes paramount to ensure that your application quality is top-notch and helps you put your best foot forward.

What are the various credentials that you need to focus on to build a stellar application package?\nGRE scores: Needless to say, a high GRE score is capable of working magic on your profile, and can both elevate the quality of a mediocre application, and further boost the worthiness of a quality profile. A high Verbal score proves your robust command over the English language and implicitly your ability to handle living and studying in an English-speaking country, while an excellent performance on the Quant section can unlock all kinds of rewarding scholarships and Teaching/Research assistantship positions.\n\nDownload eBook: Quant guide for a perfect 170 Score\n\nDownload eBook: Ultimate guide to crack GRE Verbal\nWhile the GRE is an indispensable part of most US university applications, that is not the case in Canada, Germany where language proficiency tests take precedence over the GRE. However, there are several reputed schools even in Canada that require or accept GRE scores as a part of graduate applications. Here’s a glimpse at some of the top Canadian universities that accept GRE scores, and their respective GRE requirements:\nDownload the ebook GRE Cutoff Scores for Top 35 Universities\nTOEFL/IELTS score: Both the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) are accepted at universities in Canada, Germany and the US, and seek to assess your command and fluency over the English language. Your ability to read, write, speak and listen comfortably in English will be gauged, and a score will be given accordingly.\n\nIn countries apart from USA, this lays a very important role in the admission committee’s mind as it gives a reflection of your communication abilities.\n\nIn the TOEFL iBT (Internet Based Test), each of the four sections will be marked between 0 to 30 for a possible total score of 120.\n\nOn the IELTS, marks are allotted between 0 to 9, with 0.5 increments.

While the IELTS enjoys a worldwide acceptance, the TOEFL is generally used in the US, although all American universities also accept IELTS scores. Owing to its versatility, IELTS scores are valid in over 10,000 institutions and universities worldwide, including countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany.\nDownload eBook: A Definitive Guide for IELTS here\nAcademic GPA: One of the most crucial factors that impact your admission chances would be your GPA referred to as CGPA or percentages in a lot of Indian Institutions. Given the fact that a student’s CGPA does not completely reflect the student’s potential but to a certain extent about the faculty, college & competition in the university, it’s seen as a relative criterion. To explain in simple words, your GPA is considered as good or bad depending on your topper’s GPA. Also, each country requires your to convert your GPA to scale of 4.\n\nRead about how to convert your GPA for USA, Canada & Germany here>>\nStatement of Purpose: The Statement of Purpose, or the SOP, is a crucial ingredient to a successful application. Because universities abroad typically receive hundreds of applications with similar credentials, your SOP is your one chance to showcase your individuality and your dreams and aspirations, and set yourself apart from your peers. The SOP is commonly thought to be a replacement for the personal interview, and for that reason, it is crucial that you nail it just right.

Ideally, you should get LORs from professors who have supervised your thesis or research project, Heads of Departments, or from professors who have taught you and known you for a substantial period of time, especially if they are well-known in their field and have published extensively. You can also submit LORs from employers, although it is recommended you only do this if you’ve been out of college for a few years.\nWork and research experience: As a fresh undergraduate, you aren’t typically expected to have work experience apart from the usual internship or voluntary work. However, if you do have such experience, make sure to highlight it in your CV and SOP. Most applicants tend to apply to graduate school straight after finishing undergrad, and view work experience as a filler, but work experience not only allows you to gain a fresh perspective on the world, but also facilitates the development of new, life-defining skills, and the ability to work in and lead diverse groups of people, all of which are paramount to graduate applications. As far as research is concerned, do remember, universities in the US are vastly different from Indian ones, especially because of the onus they place on research and development, to the extent where applicants with a relatively lower GPA have won admits to top schools based purely on their excellent research experience in the past. If you have substantial research experience, it would be a good idea to get your research supervisors to write you a reference letter, and also issue you any relevant certificates. Both research and work experience are especially beneficial in making up for any shortfalls in you GPA or GRE scores, and also in getting scholarships and other aid.\nWhat are the common mistakes students make while applying?\nTime, as they say, is money, and this is especially true for MS applications, where every single day is of prime importance. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that you plan your application well in advance and follow a proper timeline so that you don’t find yourself floundering for time. So what are some of the mistakes that trip up study abroad aspirants? Let’s take a look:\nStarting GRE preparation late: Your GRE, as we mentioned, is one of the most important building blocks of your application, so ideally, you must give yourself sufficient time to start preparing for the test, so you can identify your weak points and work on them properly. You also need to have enough time so that if you find your GRE scores unsatisfactory, you can choose to rewrite it.\nInability to shortlist universities: Of course, Harvard, MIT and Caltech are the dream of millions, but realistically, is your profile compatible with the stringent requirements of these universities? Before applying, draw up a list of 8-10 universities you would like to attend, based on criteria such as GRE requirements, tuition fee, acceptance rate, past admits, alum profiles, cultural & research field compatibility with faculty etc.\n\nRemember, you will be spending quite a bit on application fees, so make sure you don’t waste time and money on schools that are unrealistically out of your league.\nDownload The SELECT Strategy to Shortlist Universities eBOOK here\nLacking the relevant details about deadlines and requirements: Universities in the US and Canada are extremely strict about the application deadlines: for instance, for fall admit, applications usually close in the first week of December of the previous year. Many aspirants often fail to take cognizance of deadlines, or neglect to send in their applications keeping in mind the time it would take to reach the US. A good idea is to note down the application deadlines of the various programs you want to apply to, well in advance. Do remember that if you are applying for a scholarship, deadlines are typically earlier. Additionally, many schools have an early bird round, which closes much before the usual deadlines. Applying in an early bird round greatly improves your chances at an offer letter, so if you’re ready, you can send in your applications right in time for that!\nConsulting unofficial/inaccurate/random websites: The internet is a quagmire of information, and it is easy to fall into a trap of misinformation if you are not careful. While researching for application information, be sure to stick to only the university’s official websites. If you are still doubtful or have any questions, be sure to write to the admissions help desk of the university to be sure.\nSending an incomplete or inadequate application: Applying overseas is not as straightforward as applying to universities in India: there is a lot more paperwork involved, such as healthcare insurance, transcripts, and visas, and in order to prevent your application from being summarily rejected, you need to ensure that your application package is complete.\n\nOverwhelmed?\nDon’t worry. Please find the MS application checklist right below to help you plan your entire application process.\nDownload the eBOOK “MS Admit: The Application Checklist” here\nWe hope you found this information useful, and now have some clarity on the various building blocks to ensuring an offer letter to your dream university.

We wish you all the best on your journey forward!', 'Dear GRE aspirant,\nDo you think that modest GRE scores and backlogs would hold back a profile? No, definitely not.\nTo help you in understanding this claim better, I have a chart* with three GREedge alumni with modest GRE scores and backlogs.\n*Data obtained from GREedge’s Admission Counselling Team\nSo, these profiles are indeed testimony to the fact that apart from your GRE score, a host of other factors determine the status of your admits.\n\nNow that you know this, I’m sure you are wondering what these factors are. Based on my experience as the Co-founder of GREedge, I would like to share them with you.\n\nBefore you get to these factors, you must know the application process to know how universities shortlist candidates. This would give you a background of what universities look for in a prospective candidate.\nA general flow of the application process would look like this:\nOver the evaluation process, Universities, in general, look to scrutinize you on a holistic basis.The evaluation begins by examining your CGPA and a host of other factors. Some of these factors include the scores of your admission requirement tests, Letter of Recommendation, Statement of Purpose/essay among the rest. So, clearly understand what universities use as a sieve in screening your application.\nMost universities have some common filters. Some of them include:\nCompetitive GPA: Once your application package reaches the university, it is immediately forwarded to the Graduate Department. The first scrutiny that is made on the application is the “test of your GPA”. Your GPA speaks volumes about your application. If you are a rank-holder or if you have a consistent academic track record, then you can definitely expect some weightage. Countries like the U.S. and Germany place a huge emphasis on GPAs. For example, Georgia Tech requires an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better to pursue a Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (MS-HCI). Though you cannot completely balance your profile with high GPA, a consistent and competitive GPA will definitely add substantial value to your profile. In addition to your GPA, the following academic factors will give your application an edge too.\nTOEFL/IELTS: A great deal of emphasis is placed on your IELTS or TOEFL score apart from your GRE score. Most universities require a good TOEFL or IELTS score. For example, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, requires a minimum of 90 points in the Internet-based TOEFL (iBT). Georgia Tech, on the other hand, for the MS-HCI program, requires a minimum of 100 in TOEFL. Universities emphasize on TOEFL/IELTS scores to determine the status of TA/RA. Further, IELTS and TOEFL scores are also taken into account in determining the quantum of your scholarships and fellowships. Keep it a point to research on the minimum requirements. A TOEFL score over 100 or IELTS score over 7 will indeed add value to your profile.\nLetter of Recommendation: The basic purpose of the Letter of Recommendation is to get a person to vouch for your credentials. This, no doubt, adds value to your profile. Ensure that you get two or three Letters of Recommendation. The Letter of Recommendation must come from someone who has been associated with you. It can be your university professor or your senior at workplace. Further, it will also add value if the person who recommends you has a PhD. So, make it a point to get a commendable Letter of Recommendation and this will indeed boost the value of your profile.\nStatement of Purpose: Your SOP is just like your personal interview with the Admission Committee. Convey all that you want the Admission Committee to know about your profile.Your Statement of Purpose must be genuine and convincing. Make it a point to highlight the drive behind your Master’s program. Answer all possible questions, such as:\n\n1. Your degree of interest in your chosen field\n2. What made you apply for the particular university\n3. Why did you choose the particular course\n\nEnsure that you don’t leave out any relevant information. Make it a point to highlight all your academic achievements and professional goals. Always remember that your SOP is as good as an interview. So, draft a compelling SOP that would persuade the Admission Committee to consider your profile.\nYou can keep the following guidelines in your mind while you draft your SOP:\nPaper Publication and Research Work: Having a good number of paper publications and research work will show that you had been in touch with the academic community. Ensure that you have your papers published in international journals. Also, if you had participated in international conferences, ensure that you highlight them. A good number of paper publications and research work will indeed add points to your applications. So, even if you have not published any papers until now, get started with it. Paper publications and research work add a high impact to your profile.\nWork Experience: Work experience will be a crucial factor in adding value to your profile. Two or three years of relevant experience will add precious points to your profile. Further, it will also be a good source for your Letter of Recommendation. Though work experience is not a mandatory requirement, relevant work experience in a reputed company will add value.\nProject and Internships: Your project and internships will definitely be considered while your application is evaluated. The degree of your practical knowledge and research acumen can be demonstrated through projects and internships. So, highlight your projects and internships. Make it a point to highlight your projects and internships in an appropriate manner.\nApart from these factors, you can certainly highlight your co-curricular and extracurricular activities too. They will also be considered since they throw light on your overall personality.Though there is no set order of priority in evaluating a candidate’s profile, you can indeed make a huge impact if you can balance out your profile. So, have a balanced profile and try not to compromise on any element. Remember that universities look for candidates with a holistic profile and not someone with unilateral strength. This will indeed make all the difference.\nAll the best!', 'Note: You can follow my Quora blog for more info about higher education abroad: https://studyabroadgre.quora.com/\nSOP Evaluation here: SOP Evaluation procedure by Mihir on Study Abroad\nPS: Before I answer anything else, I will directly answer the question asked by most of the applicants: Can my GRE compensate for poor GPA/CGPA? The answer is NO. Now read everything below:\nGRE is not a big selection criterion for MS programs.\nThe selection of a candidate for MS program is a 2 stage process:\nScreening process by the admin department: This screening process goes something like, there is a list of cut-off score or threshold values for certain selection criterion. For example, all students with GRE above 310 will be cleared, or all students with CGPA above 8.0/10.0 will be selected etc. This limit is not very strict and is flexible. TOEFL is one such criterion that will fall only and only in this screening process and not evaluated for the next one, unless you are going for TA/RA, in which case they need to evaluate your English language capability (still it will be least importance).\nSelection process by Adcom: In this process, you will be judged on your GPA, GRE score, SOP, LOR etc and is highly flexible. A student with great acads but not so good GRE can be selected over a student with perfect GRE score and average acads. It depends on your whole application file BUT certain parameters weigh more than the others.\nUsually the selection criterion goes like this (in descending order):\nAcademic GPA/CGPA/%age as well as ranking in your batch\nUndergrad university\nSOP\nResearch ex/Work ex\nGRE\nLOR\nThese other factors will vary from case to case:\nFinal Year Project\nInternship and papers\nCo/Extra-curricular\nProf Letting\nProblems people might face:\nBacklogs\nYear Gap\nPlagiarism\nSome people may disagree, but this is what I personally think, seen and experienced.\nSELECTION CRITERION:\n1. Acads are the most important parameters:\nYour GPA or %age is the prime deciding factor. If you are topper in your batch and have shown outstanding academic performance, the chances are that you will be a preferable candidate for the program. Backlogs will damage your admission chances drastically. Although you can still find cases with a lot of backlogs and people still get admission in the university. Read this link at the end of the answer those who have low confidence in this area (he had 55 backlogs; read the whole thread/story).\n2. Undergrad University:\nIf you belong to one of the top universities in your country, and you have descent acads, then you have good chances of admission. BEWARE, if you are from a top university BUT your acads are weak you will have a disadvantage compared to a student who is from a descent ranking university but high GPA. That\'s how it goes, \'Be on the top where ever you are\', that\'s something to be learned not just for MS admission process but for life as well. :D\n3. Statement of Purpose (SOP):\nI personally feel that SOP is a big deciding factor in your admission. You can be a lot of different by writing an excellent SOP. Your SOP will say a lot of thing about you silently that a strong profile will never be able to speak out. SOP tells your attitude, your ambition, your clarity of thought and your personality. These sometime overweight excellent profiles. This video will help you realize the importance of a good SOP (UMass Amherst Admission Committee):\nAlso if you want to read more about it, check the link at the end of the answer.\n4. Work/Research ex, GRE and LOR:\nI will prefer not to rank them in a strict order because they will depend on the type of program you are applying to. If you are applying for a research based program, your research/work ex and LOR will be of higher value than GRE, but if may be it is not a specifically research based MS program, then if is possible that GRE may matter more. A good GRE score will certainly help. Score above 310 is considered okay-okay.... may be descent... 320+ is desirable and good... 330+ is excellent. AWA also matters and 3.0+ is almost like mandatory... 4/4+ is good.\nWork/research ex is helpful not just during MS application process but also after completing your MS when job hunting. A relevant work ex is recommended and good, but if you have work ex in a different field than what you are going to study, no promises can be made if it will help.\nIf you are interested in doing some research work and gain some research experience before applying for MS you can apply as RA at IITs under a prof. Here are some details on that: http://www.edulix.com/forum/show...\nLORs are important mainly for PhD programs. they do add some weight to the application, but only if a prominent professor from a premier institute or a high ranking official from work place writes it. It is also important to send the LOR only using the official university/company mail id of the prof/boss, else although acceptable, they will add ZERO points to application.\nFinally I will add the uncertainty factor: LUCK. :D Although they say ""The harder I work, the luckier I get.""\nUpdate: To include all the rest of the factors involved in the admission process.\nTHESE FACTORS WILL VARY FROM CASE TO CASE:\n1. Final Year Project (FYP):\nCheck this too: Mihir Gupta\'s answer to Which kind of project should I do so that I can show it in my resume for MS in US?\nThis is also one of the important deciding factors for admission, especially for one applying for MS with thesis. It will demonstrate your ability to convert your theoretical know-how into practical engineering knowledge. Also if your project is good enough, you can get a paper out of it and publish it. Sometimes, if he admission process involves an interview with a prof who is willing to take you as RA/TA, then the FYP is very important as mos of the interview questions will be from the project.\n2. Internships and Papers:\nInternship that are usually undertaken by B.Tech students in 3rd or 4th year matter only if they project assigned to them is a good one and it they do it from a reputed firm like IISC, DRDO, or some big pvt companies. Here the important thing will also be to work for a longer time as one month\'s internship won\'t be of any use. If you work for a minimum 3 months and are also able to impress your boss such that he is willing to give you recommendation, that will be the best case scene. It is also possible to try score internships abroad in a university or a company. They are a big plus for overall profile.\nResearch papers published during the final year project or internship will help those who wish to go for MS with thesis option but not very much for students aiming for MS without thesis (MEngg; 1 yr course). The impact factor of the journal you have published your work in will be considered, but not much as adcom do not expect a high quality research work from an undergrad unless it is a direct PhD application.\n3. Co/Extra-curricular:\nThese activities will not offer you any major advantage, but will make your resume/CV look bright and show that you are involved in activities other than acads. If you do not have good acads and bad GRE, then these activities will be of zero importance, on the other hand if you profile is good and you have done some nice activities, then these will provide you an edge over student who has profile similar to yours.\n4. Prof-Letting:\nThis is useful only when you think you have good admission chances and that you want to work under a prof as RA/TA under a prof during MS. For this the credentials responsible will differ. Of course acads will still hold importance, but after that will come your work ex, research ex, papers, project and LOR. There is a method required to contact profs of the desired university. You can read all about it in the link at the end of the answer.\nPROBLEMS PEOPLE MIGHT FACE:\n1. Backlogs:\nDon\'t feel disappointed if you have had a few backlogs. Although your list of universities will be a bit different compared to the one who had no backlogs, but you still do have a good chance to succeed. For this I will again link you to this guy who had 55 backlogs and still got admit and visa as well. All you need is strong motivation, hard work and will power.\nBacklog in a core subject, the one you are selecting your specialization for MS will hurt bad, but if it is in an unrelated subject, it will probably not be that bad.\n2. Year Gap:\nIf you completed your UG in 2012 and did nothing till June 2013, then it will be called a year gap. If you worked for a major part of that year (6/6+ months) then its not probably not a year gap.\nSome year gaps are acceptable. Like you took a year off to work in an NGO or may be for (Teach For India) TFI or something like that, then it is acceptable.\nThe other case may be that you were preparing for GATE or any other exam. This will be a negative factor for your profile unless you did great in that exam and that exam somehow added to your profile (like good GATE score is valuable for German universities).\nThe third case can be that you were search for job and by the end you decided to take GRE for MS. This will have really bad effect on your profile, unless you can cover it with something valuable you might have done side by side.\n3. Plagiarism:\nThis is kind of an indirect factor that may affect your chances of admit, BUT if found guilty, you may not just receive reject from the university you applied to but also from other universities you are going to apply to. Plagiarism is a serious issue when it comes to higher studies.

PM me if you need help here.', 'TOEFL will not matter, but GRE does matter for an entry to a top MS program. More importantly, once you achieve something around 167 and above in quant and 160 and above in Verbal, even GRE does not matter. These days a lot of Indian students are applying with GRE scores of 325+, so I do not think GRE will pull you up, unless you get 335+ (but anything less than 315 will pull you down).\n\nWhat matters --\n1) CGPA (higher the CGPA better are your chances. Anything with 9 pointer above will be a good bet).\n\n2) Rank (if your university of college gives you a recognised rank then say your CGPA is 8, but still you are second in class, then it shall help your case).\n\n3) Name of the institute. Better recongized is your institute, better are your chances. For example: names such as IIT, NIT or BITS do hold value.\n\n4) Internships -- If you have internship at IIT or some other good US university, then you have brighter chances of achieving an admission. If you have internships at top multinationals (such as for CS guys microsoft, IBM labs, intel, samsung and so on) then also you can secure a good MS program. Your internship at a startup can also help you, if the work done is good.\n\nThe main point to understand is at the end of the day, work matters.\n\n5) If you have research papers or some academic awards or grants, then it will help you pass through a good MS program. Publishing researh papers does not mean that a person publishes 10 papers, but the conference or journal is not even recognized. Even if you have a single paper, but from a reputed organization, then it is far better than ten.\n\n6) Contacts with foreign univeristy profesor. If you have any interaction with the professor of the college of your choice, then you have an edge.\n\n7) SOP -- A golden rule, write the truth and not stories. State your achivements and your study plans, group to join and professor to work with.\n\n\nPS: Thanx to Nikhil Prabhu for edits']"
How can I increase my GRE score?,12 Answers,['GRE Score\nGRE Preparation\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nHow can I increase my GRE score?'],"['311 is definitely not a bad score(in general). Unfortunately u have mentioned nothing about your profile. Also you have not mentioned about current branch and your intended major branch. So giving advice is a bit difficult.\nFirst of all doing masters in US/Canada, is totally different from studying in India. Since you have given GRE you might be aware of the admission process, so I won’t elaborate on it. But the important thing to know is that, while applying for master, they not only see your GRE & TOEFL scores, but also your extra curricular activities like academics, research papers, internships, social work, Good Projects, SOP, LORs, are also considered. I will elaborate on each of these individually.\nFirst for applying to any ‘good’ US university, you need to have good academics (irrespective of your major). Academics are going to play a major role in your admission. If you have good academics(ie. NO BACKLOGS and good percentages/pointer) then surely it would be easier to get admission in a good college. Good academics prove that you are a very good student academically and they won’t hesitate you to give you an admit.\nSecond, internships and research papers are going to add weightage to your profile. Having a 1–2 internship or 1 research paper would definitely add to your chances of getting into a better college. They prove that you are interested in hardwork and research field, so they won’t mind admitting you to their college. The internship and/or research papers, prove beneficial in majors such as Computer Science or Electronics branch. There are too many students applying for these branches and in order to make your profile stand out from the scores of other profiles from across the globe, internships/research papers will definitely help you out.\nThird, people in USA definitely believe in social work, and it has a high importance if you have participated in any social activity(and have a certificate for it). It definitely will help you improve your profile.\nFourth, SOP and LOR’s also play a important role. If you have a good SOP then you have the advantage. Also try to convince top faculties like senior professors, HOD or even Principal to recommend your name (to the university you want). This would definitely add advantage to your profile.\nLastly, if you have experience of working on projects or have experience of working in some good company then it would definitely help. This is especially necessary if you are applying for CS branch as your major. Also your final year project is of great importance. And if you have extra certifications, like Oracle or Microsoft(for CS), CISCO(for electronics), AUTOCAD(mech and civil), then also your profile will get an upper hand over others.\nNOW YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY I GAVE SO MUCH DESCRIPTION OF ALL THESE THINGS.\nDON’T GET NERVOUS BECAUSE OF GRE SCORE OF 311.\nIf you have the above things then you need not take the GRE again. Suppose you have 2 things like very good academics(You are in top 5 of your current univ) and have a good internship(of 1 or 3 months) or a research paper under your belt, then you need not retake your GRE. It is a very good score and you can definitely compete a student for a seat who has GRE score of 322(hands down). So you definitely need to check where you stand in all these, which all of the above mentioned “things” highlight your profile. I am emphasizing because you definitely start working on your SOP and LOR as early as possible. The admission is on first come first serve basis. So if you start applying to universities as early as October, then you will have a great chance to securing an admission as early as November or December. The more early you apply, the better chances you have of getting an early admit.\nNow since you have not mentioned about your profile, I would also tell you about the worst case scenario, i.e. you have nothing from the things I mentioned above(suppose, I hope not), then my friend you definitely need to retake the GRE.\nSO HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR SCORE.\nSince you are continuously, scoring 165 in Quants, then you need to just try and stretch your score by 4–5 marks, which is quite easy(i guess). It can only achieved by solving difficult problems from the Manhattan 5LB or you can always refer net. If you feel like you are lagging behind in a single topic like for eg, Geometry, then practice is the only option. If you are stuck in high level problems of any topics(in general) then you need to solve advance problems and also you need to improve your timing for simple problems. Now looking at your quant score of 165(i guess), you are easily able to solve simple, moderate and a few advanced problems. Now you just need to improve your speed in simple and moderate problems, so that you can shift you attention to the advanced problems. For example, if you are able to solve 1 question in 90sec, then you should bring it down to 75–80 sec for each problem. The extra 10–15 sec/problem would definitely help you get more problems in advanced problems. More time means more chances of getting a advanced problem correct. PLEASE DON’T DROP YOUR EFFICIENCY OF CURRENT QUESTIONS WHICH YOU ARE GETTING CORRECT. You need to improve in time and not drop your efficiency.\nNOW GETTING TO THE VERBAL PART. THIS PART IS DIFFICULT FOR THE MOST OF THE PEOPLE(including me).\nYou need to strategize in order to score good. First if you get long passage don’t get stuck on them. In my opinion, you can first complete all the fill in the blanks. But, to fill in the blanks correctly, you need to have good command over your words. They need to memorized perfectly. You need to practice them regularly without any mistake and you should know where and when to use a word in the sentence. For that only practice and good knowledge of vocab is necessary. If you have not learnt words perfectly, then I m sorry to say, you Cannot crack the questions. Now coming to passages, start with the smaller ones, then the medium ones and lastly the long ones. This would help, since there is generally only 1 long passages with say 3–4 questions, you can get atleast 1 question correct. But from the remaining 16–17 questions you will have to score at least 12–14 to get a good score out of 20. Don’t waste your unnecessary time on long passages. So according to my calculations(u get 13 correct in both the sections of verbal), U can get a score of 156 in verbal and 169–170 in quant which would help you to get to score of 325.\nGRE HAS A SIMPLE RULE:\nPRACTICE MORE, AND CARRY YOUR LUCK DURING THE EXAM.\n(Luck is important, if you hate verbal and unfortunately u get a verbal in experimental, then it would be bad, because no one wants to see the verbal section thrice in those 4 hr marathon race.)\nHope I have satisfied you to a certain extent.\nIF YOU MENTION YOUR PROFILE IN DETAIL, I WOULD DEFINITELY LOVE TO HELP YOU(whether you should retake the GRE and any other doubts).\nMY SUGGESTION: IF YOU HAVE GOOD PROFILE, THEN BETTER START WITH YOUR SOP,TRANSCRIPTS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS.\nBEST OF LUCK.', 'Majority of students spend between two and three months preparing for the GRE. Given we all struggle to sustain our attention and concentration for more than this long, such a duration makes perfect sense. After all, life’s inevitable “bumps” and distractions are far more likely to derail you during a six months studying for the GRE that you are better off giving it your all over a period of 2 to 3 months. Here is the perfect plan for those who can commit both the time and the cognitive resources necessary for a few months.\nA study plan of Catking will give structure to your preparation and will ensure that you are preparing the right way.\nMONTH 1: Target Quant\nGRE tests you on high school Maths only. You will not be tested on advanced topics such as calculus.\n• The GRE Maths maybe a little more intimidating for you if you didn’t have Maths in high school. Though the engineering students may not find Maths tested on the GRE to be very challenging, but they will see that they would have forgotten quite a few concepts and you may know how to solve a question but you may not know how best to solve a question.\nGo through the GRE Study material provided by CATKing\nStart going through the Maths concepts from the Official Guide and simultaneously start with the Quant concepts and formulae document in our lesson module section to get familiar with what you’d be up against.\n• Go through the topics one by one and do a sufficient number of questions from each topic so that you understand not only the concepts but their application too.\n• Start taking maths tests from our online test and do a thorough analysis of the questions.•\nOnce you’ve identified the weak area, patch up those areas by going through the topic again and spending sometime on it. By the end of one month, you should be prepared enough for Maths and you should be ready to move on to the next challenge that is verbal.\nMONTH 2: Focus on Verbal\nStart with a topics provided in lesson modules, learn the strategies and then practice 10-15 questions from that topic per day. Make sure that you spend a good amount of time in analyzing the questions.•\nIf you would have been reading editorials daily as suggested in month 1, by the second month, your comprehension skills would have improved quite a lot and you should be able to read complex passages. As you prepare for Verbal in the second month, remember that you do not stop studying Maths altogether. A good idea is to do 5 Maths questions everyday so that you feel that you are in touch with maths.•\nFor Sentence Equivalence and Text Completion, you’ll have to primarily do Vocabulary, so in the first week, learn root words. This will make learning words a much more logical process and will give you a good foundation to learn words. Check out Verbal ability videos on Youtube which would also help you to prepare for GRE\n• Book your GRE date in the second week.\n• In the second week, practice Text Completion and Sentence Equivalence questions. If you’d have gone as per the suggested plan, you shouldn’t face much difficulty in doing these questions. Do not freak out learning very difficult words.\n• Start with the Reading comprehension part in the third week of this month. Go through the Types of questions tested on. Learn the strategies for tackling each type of question. For example, the strategy for tackling an inference question is absolutely different from that used for tackling detail questions.\nMONTH 3: Practicing and Reviewing\nThis month should be spent in taking full length tests, reviewing them and addressing your test taking weaknesses.•\nTake two full length tests provided by CATking. Take these practice tests preferably at the same time of the day for which you have booked your slot for. This will help your body get used to the timing.•\nIn the first week, book your GRE date, if you haven’t already done so. In some testing centres, the GRE dates may not be easily available all the more so during the peak test taking season so it’s best to book it in the second month itself.•\nIn the third week, take two more full length tests. Save one for the last week.•\nIn the last week, take only one exam. Make sure that you take this exam at least 3 days before the exam.•\nSleep well during the last few days. Do not study anything new in the last few days; rather focus on revising whatever you have done so far. Relax completely on the last day before the exam.•\nTake the GRE and blow it away!', ""As far as your your efforts are concerned, these are commendable that you want to chase the score and aspiring to get it more. At this juncture you are suggested to do some change in the preparation strategy. Here are some of the common mistake to avoid while preparing for GRE and during the test -\nDon’t scrimp on study materials - Just go though an ideal material such as - books, notes etc. Never read the books in jiffy. Give more attention and concentration to the what are you studying. Purchase some ideal books for the well structured preparation.\nTake GRE Practice Tests every weekend - Every often just appear for the sample practice test. Many people save practice tests for last 10 days before exam.\n I do not recommend this strategy, instead I advise you to do practice tests every weekend since it helps you to identify your weak areas, so you can concentrate more on them and subsequently find out the remedy.\nDo not underestimate quantitative section of New GRE - GMAT - math is not tough but challenging, so don't take it for granted. Just go through NCERT books for the conceptual clarity and then to the ideal practice book for GMAT. Then only you could be able to it more properly. Please do not make a mistake of underestimating quantitative section. Many of us are of impression that getting through quants section is just a cake walk (even I was under the same impression).\n Remember GRE math isn’t hard but it’s tricky. Without enough practice and proper strategies it can turn out to be a major score bummer. Quants is the scoring part of GRE and ideally Indians are considered good at math so with enough practice it can boost up our score.\nVerbal section is not just about vocabulary it is more than that - you can’t crack verbal section of GRE just by learning words, however that doesn’t mean vocab is useless. You need vocabulary for Text completion and Sentence equivalence.\n As ETS states emphasis on vocab is reduced and I experienced this as a trainer. Please note that 50% of question in verbal were from RC’s where vocab doesn’t help you much. Even in sentence Equivalence and Text Completion, you have to focus on nuances in sentences and learn to work in context. Just to say, there are many who memorized 5000 word list and scored less than 145.\nNo last minute preparation- Never keep the preparation pending for the last moment. Always be up to the mark. Be prepared for the test thoroughly.\nBest of luck..!!"", 'The GRE is an intriguing test, mystifying to many. Often we find students getting complacent that it is easy to crack without much training and a popular misconception is that only the Verbal section could be a challenge to work towards. However, the reality is quite contrary. Along with Verbal, students, in spite of a strong potential fail to get close to a 170 in Quant, and often end up in the low 160’s. In verbal often students end up around 150’s with a resultant total of 310. But you can score high, and remember higher the score, the better the universities where you can apply and higher the chances of admit and even scholarships!\nHere are few Tips to increase GRE scores-\nTarget your dream school, not your dream GRE score, and work backward.\nConsistent practice. Getting higher GRE score is not difficult; with proper coaching and consistent practice, high GRE score is possible.\nKnow your concepts well\nKeep a track on your speed\nHow to Crack the GRE Quant\nThe test is tricky and section adaptive. Students often fail to identify the traps and end up marking the wrong answer. Constant practice will train you to avoid such traps and think quickly. The main hurdle on the test is speed. If you know the concepts that you are tested on well, you can go through the major part of the test quickly with a minute per question. This gives you enough time to solve the tougher questions, especially the Data Interpretation questions which will typically take more than 2 minutes per question.\nUnderstand, what is judged is your analytical capability, and not just your mathematical knowledge.\nHere is one example to help you understand-\nColumn A: Number of factors of 100\nColumn B: Number of factors of 441.\nIs A > B; B > A; A=B or cannot be determined.\nThe concept requires you to prime factorize i.e. 100 = 22 * 52 and 441 = 32*72. The number of factors of each thus is 3 * 3 = 9 factors (using rule of counting). Thus the two columns are equal. If you know this concept you can do the question quickly. There are many such concepts in each of the main topics namely, Numbers, Statistics, Geometry, Coordinate Geometry, Sets, Speed Time Distance, Work Rate time, Counting and Probability. Knowing these concepts ensures you are fast in the test. Remember to always practice in sets of 20 questions, and time yourself - 35 minutes for a set of 20 Questions for Quant and 30 minutes for a set of 20 Questions for Verbal.\nHow to crack GRE Verbal\nIn the Verbal section, students tend to memorize words in isolation and that is a foolproof way of practicing for failure in the actual test of Sentence Completion and Sentence Equivalence. In the older version of GRE, students were tested on synonyms and antonym questions and at that time rote memorization used to be helpful. But in the new GRE, you need to have knowledge of words in the context of sentences. In most of the tough questions the words are not that difficult; however, the meaning of the sentence and the connections between the blanks is tough to comprehend. One needs to practice and develop the skill of drawing meaning of the sentences from the clue words and transition words and predicting answers of the blanks.\nWhen building your vocabulary, try to understand words rather than memorize. Also, make sentences of your own which will make the meaning of the word stick in your memory. For example, consider the word ‘anachronism’. An easy way to understand this word is to break it as ana + chron + ism. This allows you to see that the root is ‘chron’. We know that chronology means pertaining to time. Thus this word must be related to time. ‘Ana’ is a prefix which means ‘out of’. Thus anachronism must be something which is out of chronological time. Now to easily remember this word make a sentence – for example, ‘Sword is an anachronism in modern warfare’. Ice the cake by writing down a few synonyms of the words. If you learn in this way not only will you understand the usage of words but it will be very helpful in Sentence Equivalence where you need to find two words which have similar meanings.\nLastly, let’s address the most challenging section, Reading Comprehension. There are many strategies to handle RCs and you need to use the strategy that works for you. For most, the strategy which works best is to scan quickly the first time, understand the main idea of the passage and each paragraph, rather than the details. You can then go to the questions and start reading the specific details of the passage pertaining to each question.\nLast but not least, the most important thing to remember in order to increase your GRE score is to write a lot of genuine tests and analyze your mistakes carefully. Try and find out what kinds of mistakes are recurring. Are you getting caught in traps? Did you make any concept mistakes? Did you make reading and understanding errors? This analysis is the key to high scores.\nA little tip on improving AWA score.\nRemember, if you fail to prepare, you are preparing to fail!\nGood Luck…']"
How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,100+ Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I plan my preparation for the GRE?'],"['GRE has three main components namely verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing. Your entire preparation process should revolve around acquiring good skills on these areas and mastering the concepts required.\nSome of the things which you can do to get the required concept clarity are\nQuantitative reasoning:\nThe best part about GRE Math is the absence of things which most of us hate in Math - The integral calculus, trigonometry and other complicated stuff. GRE Math is mostly things which you learned in junior/ high school - Things like interger properties, word problems (rate of work, speed, probability etc) which can be solved with basic common sense. Not much beyond that.\nWhat makes the GRE so tricky is the interpretation of the questions part. Once you figure out what the question is asking, the math involved is definitely easier than what you faced in your high school. In fact, it is more fun as you don\'t need to write down each and every step and show your teacher on how you arrived at your answer. You just need to pick an answer. In short, the math section just tests your ability to reason with numbers.\nVerbal reasoning:\nVerbal reasoning section is even more simple with there being only 3 question types - text completion, critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The preparation process should be fully focused on knowing specific strategies for cracking these questions rather than generic preparation advocated.\nFor example, use of flash cards for learning new words was very helpful in the earlier format of the test where antonyms and analogies were asked and there was more emphasis on rote learning of words. But, the current format focuses more on understanding not only the literal meaning of the words but also the metaphorical use of the word based on the context. For example, while the word \'opaque\' literally means \'not transparent\', it could also mean \'difficult to interpret or understand\' if used in the right context. Similarly, there are no questions asking you to identify any grammar errors. Grammar is important only for your essay writing section. Hence, it makes sense not to rely on these old fashioned methods advocated by coaching institutes but to just keep focusing on the 3 question types.\nAnalytical writing:\nAnalytical writing section asks you to write 2 essays - one on ""The Issue"" and the other on ""The Argument"". The major difference here is in the first essay you are asked to take a stand on a complex issue whereas in the second essay you are asked to dissect the logic behind an already taken stand or position.\nHow do I prepare for this? You just need to follow a simple routine and you are guaranteed to score well in this section.\nChoose - Structure - Write - Compare - Improve - Choose\nStep 1: You choose a topic where you already have some well written sample essays. You can pick these up either in the official site or from the many blogs available online.\nStep 2: Come up with a structure and an outline.\nStep 3: Write an essay by developing the structure and the outline.\nStep 4: Compare it with other essays written on the topic.\nStep 5: Rewrite your essay to improve it.\nStep 6: Go to Step 1.\n--------------------\nIf you do all of the above, you are going to definitely score well on your GRE.\nCheck out Magnus Prep\'s GRE Program if you are looking for some great mentors to help with your GRE preparation.\nCheers!', 'When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.\n\nNote: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.\n\n1. First Month: Conditioning\nAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don\'t have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nWork out (don\'t just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.\nIn parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well)\n\nFourth Week:\nTime for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don\'t forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)\nMeanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.\n\nSo, it\'s been one month now. Don\'t expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.\n\n2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull\'s Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way\nNow it\'s time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don\'t think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I\'m going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nSign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It\'s a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.\nJoin the New GRE group on Facebook. It\'s the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:\nMembers post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.\nSecondly, it\'s a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation.\nYou\'ll get access to some really USEFUL links.\nThe next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.\nThe last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don\'t forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.\nNow you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it\'s time for some real action !!\nFourth Week\nTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that\'s all its useful for. Don\'t expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms\n\n3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racer\n\nFirst Two Weeks\nPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don\'t leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don\'t, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn\'t take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I\'m telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.\n\nLast Two Weeks\nIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I\'d read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:\n\n20 online tests\n\n800Score\'s Free Full Length Revised GRE Test\n\nMyGRETutor\'s 4 free Full Length Tests\n\nKaplan\'s Free Practice Test Options for the GRE\n\nPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length test\n\nIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!\n\nOriginally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?', 'Quant - 170 Verbal- 164 AWA- 4.5/6\nI recently gave my GRE on 28th September 2017. Although I started my preparation 3 months prior to the examination I could not continue due to the fact that I am also preparing for other competitive exams. Also I was put down by Chicken pox and Typhoid for a month. Effectively I had little more than a month to prepare for the test. So I was quite surprised with the result that I got as you can see above. Here is how I prepared for my GRE test.\nStudy Material -\nMagoosh GRE prep account (most important)\nMagoosh Vocabulary builder (words flashcard app)\nManhattan prep GRE 5 lb. book of gre practice problems\nManhattan GRE Prep Reading comprehension and Essay\nOfficial Guide for GRE by ETS (all three books)\nVarious news sites such as The New Yorker , The Economist etc. ( as prescribed on Magoosh GRE blog).\nStudy Plan -\nI started my preparation at the start of the month of July . As I told earlier I am also studying for other competitive exams so I could’nt devote much time to GRE. I studied for maximum 3 hours each day. I also did’nt study according to any plan. Some days it was only vocab building by flashcards and reading articles. Some days it was practicing problems Some days divided between both. Also I watched Magoosh GRE video lessons and I can say they were very useful.\nThis is a tip for students from engineering background preparing for GRE. Don’t ignore the quantitative section even if it seems easy to you. Practice it as you would the verbal section.\nAfter recovering from my maladies I had approx 5 weeks to prepare for GRE. So I decided to tidy up my routine so\nI increased my GRE study time to 5–6 hours per day\nIn a day I would first go through my magoosh flashcards and try to learn atleast 30 new words per day and also revise a few old words. Also I made a point to read and understand atleast 2 news articles per day .\nThen I would practice quantitative for approx 1 hour . I generally used timed custom practice test in Magoosh GRE account.\nFor next 2 hours I would go through practicing the verbal section and writing essays.\nI learnt how to read the paragraphs swiftly and in detail. Again Magoosh video lessons were very important in this regard.\nUnfortunately I was not able to give any full practice test due to my surroundings but I would recommend everyone to give atleast one of them.\nMy main focus was on improving my vocab by learning new words , their meaning and context of their uses as it appeared to me to be very useful for Sentence equivalence and Text completion questions. Again and I cannot stress this enough watching Magoosh video lessons was very important.\nI practiced and practiced as much as my schedule allowed me to.\nOn the day of the examination\nReach the centre atleast 1 hour prior to the commencement of test as there are plenty of verification to be done before the examination. Also carry a water bottle with you. GRE is very attentively conducted examination and staff of testing centres are very vigilant. If you have any problem feel free to ask for their help.\nGRE is a very easy exam as you can see in my case , with a directed and concentrated approach you can score very well ( 330+) within a relatively short amount of prep time.\nBe well , Be prepared and best of luck.', 'I’ve been tutoring the GRE for a number of years. The below is inspired by the many sessions I’ve had with students, many of whom have gone on to do very well on the GRE. A lot of it is also specific to the revised GRE, which made its debut in August 2011.\n \n1. Use official material\n \nWhen preparing for the GRE, no questions prepare you better than the ones written by ETS, which is responsible for writing the questions you will see test day. As much as possible, stick to the questions in the Official Guide to the GRE so you can wrap your mind around how the test writers want you to reason.\n \nYou may not think that it makes that much of a difference, but many publishers out there have questions that require you to make certain leaps of logic—or employ questionable logic—that you will never have to do on the actual test. Then there is the fact that many questions simply aren’t as difficult or nuanced as the questions you’ll see test day. This is a problem many students encounter when using Kaplan—you are essentially taking a dumbed down version of the GRE, with often poorly constructed questions to boot.\n \n\n2. Take practice tests\n \nThere is no better way to prepare for test day than actually taking a mock test. You will train yourself to sit for three plus hours staring at a screen, as you are pummeled by an onslaught of GRE problems.\n \nIf possible, use only the official tests, found in the Official Guide to the New GRE. There are four such tests—two that comes with the book, and two that are computer-based and come with the CD that is part of the book. Stagger these out  over the four weeks you are prepping, so that there are no fewer than five days between tests and no more than ten days. If you are studying longer, you might also want to consider Manhattan GRE tests (see below).\n \nFinally, practice tests will allow you to better assess your strengths and weaknesses, and help inform your study sessions in between tests.\n \n \n3. Focus on weaknesses\n \nMake sure not to get carried away developing those areas in which you already excel. For instance, if you are generally strong at math problem solving questions, but if you dislike Data Interpretation (that’s the section with all the graphs), then the last thing you want to do is avoid that section. Instead make it a priority to become confident and effective at all questions relating to Data Interpretation.\n \n \n4. Use the best material\n \nWhile official material is clearly the best prep out there, it doesn’t necessarily provide the most effective strategies. You may want to take a look at Princeton Review for helpful big picture strategies. As for specific strategies for almost every aspect of the GRE—from permutations to convoluted paragraph arguments—the Manhattan GRE books (MGRE) are the best. MGRE also has six practice tests that mimic the actual test very well (though this more so with math than with verbal). For more practice on the online format, Magoosh also offers questions that are similar to--and often more difficult--than those found on the actual test. (I should probably mention that I work for Magoosh :))\n \nOf course there is a lot of material out there that should be avoided, especially in terms of practice content.

But I did use GREedge and can vouch for it.I recently gave my GRE and can say confidently that I scored a good score. DUring the start of my preparations a few months before I too was confused between the two and while enrolling was thinking on for which of these two online preps should I register for. For me the choice was simple as I did want to score better than last year. I went with GREedge for a simple reason that it's based out of India where I am from and It did have positive reviews and recommendations from some who had earlier enrolled for their prep courses.I enrolled two months before my exam and took an appropriate course. The course material was very thorough, both for the verbal and Quant Sections. Their SFA’s (Student Advisors) were very supportive and did answer all the doubts and questions posed to them, with additional materials to practise whenever requested. I personally found them good at their jobs in guiding students. They also assisted in completing the course on schedule. Their web interface was also pretty adaptable and could start at get go from the very beginning. Just had an issue with their word bots but then am pretty bad at mugging up things leave alone 8000+ words. Even after enrolling to any of the courses (which you must choose after a good research about either of them so that they are suitable for you, just keep in mind its always better if you also parallely prepare in your own time with the additional materials because the better you practise the better score you get. So, all the best."", ""I was enrolled with GRE edge for 4 months and I must say that their service is really pathetic. Their so called “ Personal SFA’s “ call only when they have another offer for u ( like when they want you to subscribe for the TOEFL prep on their portal ). My verbal sfa never picked up the call and their is always this communication gap. What these SFA’s do is basically they chalk out a plan , and that’s it. The plan is created in such a manner that u complete the whole portal before ur GRE (including some style tests and a few full tests as well). So their is no rocket science in this.\nDuring these 4 months , I was contacted only 4–5 times by them . ( That's how personal they get. ) I expected these guys to call me at least before my D day to discuss any sought of plans or strategies or a little motivation maybe!! But I Only received a computer generated mail and text sms saying all the best , and a few tips here and their. That's it.\nContent wise they are okay . But do not expect anything more. Also , their portal looks very out dated and mechanical. ( No videos , only text,) I also found it hard to skip topics sometimes. (Unless you complete the one before ) So it does lack a sense of flexibility .\nThe only thing I liked was the wordbot app which helps u to learn words using mnemonics. You can even revise words by filtering out the list u are focusing on .\nIn conclusion i would say that, it really depends on your preparation level and what score you are aiming for. It’s always better to go for standard books and materials. I haven’t used magoosh , but from what i have heard , their content ,videos,strategies are top notch and they have been in this race for quiet a long time .And they do stand out when it comes to the content. (without any doubt). It would be wise to not get fooled by terms like “Personal SFA” or “Personal tutor”. Ultimately it’s all your effort that adds up. The only reason why i took up online GREEdge was because i had to juggle between my job and gre prep(otherwise i would have opted for physical classes rather than online), and i thought that this concept of “personal SFA” might keep me focused throughout the journey. But only later i realized how cleverly this B.S. concept was sold to me .\nP.S. Not trying to denigrate GreEdge . Some XYZ might have had a better experience than i had, and it’s totally fine. Just thought that it would be great to share it in a forum . Cheers!"", 'I recently gave my GRE scored 311{Q:162;V:149;W:4}. Some may find this to be a very average score as compared to 320+ or 330+ which people get so frequently. Then again we should primarily understand that we do not learn anything new for the purpose of taking GRE, instead our aptitude is tested on the things we already know and have had these stuff as a part of our coursework at some part of our academics. I have a lot of respect for the people who do not prefer any assistance while preparation.\nHowever I felt that I needed some assistance as I was out of touch with academics for 2 years almost. Also the people whom I live with at present are not into such a culture. I enrolled for GRE-EDGE as a few of my batchmates had already excelled in GRE with this organisation and suggested me to take up one of their programs. I would try to be as much unbiased as possible and go on with my experience as I never enrolled for magoosh as most of their material were already availavle in form of free apps or free videos.\nNow what I liked about EDGE was that they had variety of difficulty levels. So I was bound to practice more and more. A personal facilitator is assigned to every enrolled student who would provide constant feedback to the student. In my case I took the initiative to go after my facilitators, I used to e-mail them on a regular basis and they would get back to me on mail with resoonse to each and every query.\nI felt the 2 major regions where I feel I was got the benifit out of the program were:-\nTime Management: EDGE questions(advanced practice+mock) are having higher difficulty levels. In my actual GRE I had a lot of time to go back to each question and revise.\nQuestion Oreintation: My facilitators had mailed me certain materials apart from the learning portal. Mostly PDF samples, which gave me idea on certain tips and tricks(4Q), slideshows for SE and RC tricks, sample essays (4W) rated 1–6 like how I should write and how I should not.\nI feel GRE-EDGE even though is not as famous as magoosh, but they do offer valued service an you can well go ahead with any one of their programs.']"

What is the key to scoring more than 160 points on the verbal section of the new GRE?,22 Answers,['Graduate Record Examination (GRE)\nExams and Tests\nWhat is the key to scoring more than 160 points on the verbal section of the new GRE?'],"[""I gave the GRE in August 2013 and scored 335 (Q: 170, V: 165) . This is what worked for me :\n\n 1. Reading the newspaper daily :\n\nThis is a must. I used to read the entire thing, even the news that didn't interest me at all. I underlined all the words I didn't know and later wrote them down in a diary with a sentence example to remember how they're used. Reading the paper is also good practice for the comprehension section, it helps in increasing your 'flow' .\n\n\n2. Reading a lot in general :\n\n   Try reading books of genres you don't particularly like. I , for example, read some of the classics which bored me to death but eventually helped a great deal with the comprehensions. Some GRE comprehensions can be really dull and you need to develop the sense to read things you're not interested in.\n\n\n3. Cramming a high frequency wordlist\n   \nBuy some practice modules like Barron's and try cramming at least 30-40 words a day. And DON'T do this orally. Write everything down. Revise the words you learnt yesterday before  starting with today's words. And at the end of the week, revise all the words you crammed that week. You're bound to forget no matter how much time you spend on learning them. Use some tricks to remember the words. It can be frustrating but don't get disheartened.\nThere are always some words which no matter what you do, you just can't memorize. Make a separate list of these words and religiously 'worship' them everyday.\n\nYou can also learn some root words like 'cog', which is related to the brain. So COGnizance is knowledge and to COGitate is to think. This'll help you surmise the meaning of words you don't know directly.\n\n\n4. Most of all, PRACTICE\n \nLots and lots of practice is needed if you really want a good score. Make sure you have plenty of practice material. You can find some free material online as well. Don't forget to TIME YOURSELF. This is very, very important. If the verbal section is of 25 minutes duration , you should set the timer to 20 minutes. You might not be able to complete the section within this duration in the beginning, but trust me, eventually you will. Train your brain to work under pressure.\n\n\n\nThat's all the advice I can give. This won't be easy and you'll have your moments of frustration, but you have to keep pushing yourself out of your comfort zone if you really want to achieve something."", ""Thanks for asking me to answer! :) I will tell you what I feel is the key to get 160+ in verbal section. Some of my friends have also followed this, and most of them have got 160+ so, I think there must be something right about this.\n\nYou need to do improve the following skills, depending on the time you have left. (See my answer to Is three months sufficient to prepare for the GRE?)\n\nVocabulary :\nYou need not learn thousands of words, but good vocabulary always translates into a good score.\nLearn the most frequent words (Barrons 333, Kaplans 400..) and then make yourself familiar with the jargon in NYTimes, Washington Post etc.,\nUse it or Lose it. You can improve the vocabulary only by using them.\n\nReading Comprehension Skills :\nPractice a lot. This will be significantly helpful for your graduate study as well.\nUse online MSTs as well as sites like RC Practice Utility By Lagnajeet Pradhan. I found the book Manhattan Reading Comprehension succinct and helpful. You should look at that at least once.\n\n\nSentence Equivalence and Text Completion Skills\nThe key to score more in SE and TC is smart guesswork and reasoning. Guess the meaning (if you don't know it), guess the answer , see if your guess is in the options available and reason out why the other options are wrong.\nAnother key is to follow specific strategies (to save time). Manhattan SE and TC should be really helpful\n\n\nActually the key to score more than 160 in vocab, is to keep calm and be confident. Don't add too much weight to the score. Just enjoy the process and practise a lot before you take the actual GRE.\n\nAll the best! :)"", ""How to Achieve more than 160 on the Verbal section (Quora)\n \n \nGetting above 160 on the GRE verbal is going to be very challenging, especially if you’ve never been much of a reading person. That doesn’t mean such an increase is impossible. Indeed, I’ve seen quite a few students go from the lower 150’s to well over 160 (and a few who’ve gotten there after starting off at a sub-150).\n \nIn each instance, the person has displayed laser-like focus and remarkable resilience. Yet those traits alone will not help you crack the 160 mark. You’ll need to keep the following in mind:\n \n1.   Understand how vocabulary works in context\n \nThe GRE verbal is mainly about vocabulary. Even the RC section often relies on your ability to know a vocabulary word (words such as perfunctoriness have show up in answer choices). At the same time, simply knowing the rote definition of a word isn’t going to get you very far.\n \nInstead you must learn how words function in context. A great way to do this is by looking up example sentences online. For instance, let’s say your flashcard defines perfunctory as performed merely as a typical duty; superficial. You can ingrain that definition into your head and still be totally flustered if perfunctory shows up as one of the answers in a Text Completion. That’s because you really aren’t equipped—by that definition alone—to know if perfunctory fits on the blank.\n \nOn the other hand, if you go to Wordnikand read several example sentences, or use flashcards with well-thought out example sentences (Manhattan GRE (MGRE) and Magoosh, come to mind), then you are far more likely to get a grasp of how to use perfunctory in a sentence. (I should mention that I work for Magoosh!).\n \nAnd that’s the key to success on the GRE verbal: knowing not just the denotative (dictionary/flashcard definition) but also the connotative definition (the ways—both figurative and literal—that a word can function in a scholarly context).\n \n\n2.   Read voraciously, and outside of your comfort zone\n \nYour reading brain is a muscle. If it has been out of use—or you’ve mainly been reading your friends’ tweets or FB updates—then that muscle has most likely atrophied. Doing dull and dry GRE reading passages will definitely snap it back into shape. However, you want to exercise that muscle throughout the day, and doing only GRE reading passages will try even the doughtiest person’s sanity. The New Yorker and The New York Timesare great places to start.\n \nIf you need something even more challenging, I highly recommend Arts & Letters Daily, which will definitely take you out of your comfort zone. The articles are scholarly, dense, and challenging. And remember—whenever you encounter words you don’t know, look those words up and try to get a better sense of how they function in context.\n \n \n \n3.   Use material that is as difficult or more difficult than what you’ll see test day\n \nThere are quite a few test prep companies out there with material that is much easier than what you’ll see on the actual GRE. Unless you are just starting to prep, doing such passages won’t help much. And if you are going for the 160+, then they may very well hurt you.\n \nInstead, use prep material that is as difficult, if not more difficult than what you’ll see test day. The LSAT guides, for one, are great troves of formidably opaque and ridiculously recondite reading passages. Manhattan GRE prep's  online tests contain Text Completions and Sentence Equivalence questions with very twisted sentence structure. Some of the Magoosh TC’s (according to our customers, at least) are harder than what you’ll see test day.\n \n \n\n\n4.   Build up your stamina\n \nYou may be able to whip through a tough passage and a set of daunting Text Completions with no problem. Yet those very questions that you breezed through will seem a lot more difficult when you are sitting in the testing center after three straight hours of GRE.\n \nMake sure you do plenty of mock tests (math included!) to build up your stamina.\n \n \nFinally, as I mentioned in the beginning, you need focus and perseverance. Learning all these words is like learning an entirely new language. But by following the above, you can break into the rarefied realm of the 160+ GRE verbal score."", ""You'd be able to get that score in verbal if you are into reading , maybe right from your childhood. This was what helped me when I took my GRE last year.\n \nHowever, if you don't really like reading, you might have to work hard for a few months at least to get a feel of the type of questions they ask on the GRE.\n \nYou need to work simultaneously on vocabulary and reading comprehension. Your goal should be to minimize the time you need to solve the sentence  completion and text completion questions, thereby maximizing the time available for reading comprehension. Reading comprehension is where you'll be really tested, even if you think you have a great command over English.\n \nUse the Barron's word list. Don't try to mindlessly cram words everyday. This might just help you on the exam but not in the long run. I used to pick up the list when I was free and I never got bored reading about words. Try to pick out roots from the words as you go along. For example ' mem' ( Memory, memoir, memento, memorial, memorandum etc.) Imagine situations where you'd use the words and create sentences in your head using the word you learnt.\n \nCreate strong associations with words. Associate the words' meanings with familiar entities. If you can't remember what a 'pugilist' is, try remembering that ' Million Dollar Baby' was about a pugilist. Images worked for me , so you can try to associate vivid, familiar images with words that are hard to remember.\n \nUse flash cards. Try to read about how a word came into being just the way it is. I would recommend Norman Lewis's Word Power Made Easy. Although I didn't read it completely, it was what made my learning about words experience funny and enjoyable.\n \nAn important advice for all verbal questions is : Exploit the context. You'd not be asked a word's meaning on the GRE without being given a context for that word. You can try to find out the tone of the sentence surrounding a difficult word and then at least partially guess the meaning of the word.\n \nI cannot stress on this enough: Practice.\n \nRCs can be nightmare if you are not prepared for them. The more difficult ones that I had on my GRE had a peculiar quality to them. The meaning and the conclusions were very elusive and I was frequently tempted to change my answers. I had to read the passages once, twice, thrice to understand the nuances. I had solved a large number of passages during my preparation but still I thought more would've helped. Try to solve many, many passages.\n \nFinally, don't forget to take the two official GRE practice tests that come with the CD. Your score in them will most likely reflect the score you'd be getting on the real test. I scored 330 and 332 on those tests and my actual GRE score turned out to be 334.\n \n \n \n \n*I will update this answer soon adding more details to it*""]"
How do I score 340 on the GRE?,5 Answers,['Looking (TV series)\nGRE Preparation\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nExams and Tests\nHow do I score 340 on the GRE?'],"['This isn’t directly responsive to your question, but I wonder why you would want to waste precious days and weeks pursuing this goal. OK, if you enjoy mental challenges like this, perhaps it would be fun for you to try to get a 340 — and then you can go take the Mensa test and get another number to brag about.\nBut if you think that getting a 340 on the GRE — instead of, say, a 320 — is going to get you into a good grad school, I think you may be disappointed, even if you do manage to get that 340.\nI can’t speak for every graduate program, of course, but over the years I have evaluated and rated hundreds of applications for PhD programs in Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science — among the top-rated CS programs in the world by almost any measure.\nAnd despite all this experience, I just had to go look up what a 340 score on the GREs means. I always look at the GRE percentile scores and not the arbitrary numerical scores, and so do most of my colleagues. If you’re from a good school that we know about, we look mostly at your grades (and at what courses you did well in), and not at the GREs.\nAlso, we admit a lot of students from China and India who have good quantitative scores, but pretty weak verbal and writing scores. I always figure that, even if the person can communicate pretty well in English, taking the GRE in English is going to be unfairly hard for them, so I look mostly at the TOEFL scores to see if they can function in English.\nAbout the only time I pay serious attention to the GRE scores is if I can’t make sense of the undergrad university’s grading system, or if the GRE is so much lower than the applicant’s grades that it makes me suspicious.\nThat’s just one data point, but if you’re tempted to spend time trying to optimize the last few points on your GRE score, I would strongly suggest spending that time on a research project instead, or reading a few more papers in the field you want to go into.', 'My answer is based on what I\'ve gleaned from own experiences and from conversations with others who have scored 338 or above.\nPreparing for the exam\n\nFirst, you should start out as a decent test-taker. Pre-preparation, you\'ll want to start out scoring at least 325-330 (if not higher) on your first couple of practice exams before deciding to aim for a 340.* Additionally, it helps to have taken and done well on other exams written by ETS, such as the SAT, if only to have familiarized yourself with the general style of ETS\'s question writing.\n\nSecond, practice. Once you start consistently scoring at least 165-167 on each section, you have all the fundamentals down. You might want to brush up on a little bit of math or some vocabulary words that you\'re missing here and there, but otherwise it\'s practice all the way. Once you get up into the 336+ range, especially, the only thing that separates a 339-340 and a lower score is a couple mistakes. Consistency and practice are the difference-makers here.\n\nFor this reason, I would strongly recommend doing computerized practice questions only (and there are services that offer more practice questions in the official computerized format than you could possibly need). You want to have the comfort of ""home-court advantage"" when taking a test—if the home team gets an additional 3-4 points per game per college basketball game, then being intimately familiar with the computerized test format might be the difference maker between a 339 and a 340. By the end, I was really fast at clicking the bubbles, marking questions, and navigating through the test in general. It might seem trivial, but the advantage of ""getting in the zone"" (not to mention saving a few seconds per section) is priceless.\nTest-day war plan\n\nMake multiple full passes through each section. Strategy-wise, I took at least two passes through each quantitative reasoning section, doing the problems from scratch each time. With enough speed gained through practice, I was able to make a comfortable pass through each section in less than half the time allotted. It\'s definitely probable that most test-takers could get a 170 from doing just one careful pass (and maybe one check pass), but I felt that I maximized my chances (if only by a tiny bit) by doing the problems really quickly more than once.\n\nOn the first and second passes, I would mark a question (and come back on a second or third pass) if I was slightest bit unconfident about my answer. On the second pass, especially, try your best to ignore what you did on your first pass; furthermore, I would recommend starting from the end of the section (the harder questions) first. This is extremely crucial for catching the small mistakes or consistent mis-readings of questions that often create one or two mistakes on the quantitative reasoning section. I would save a third pass just as a general sanity check or for one or two questions that I marked from the first two passes. If I felt that time was running down, I\'d start checking the marked questions halfway through the second pass.\n\nSimilarly, I would take at least two passes through each verbal reasoning section but wouldn\'t necessarily re-read the passages. Here, the emphasis was more on a couple of trickier questions (which I would mark during the first pass). It was harder for me to get a 170 on the verbal reasoning section but for a different reason: it was less about random mistakes and more about honing in on a few tricky questions. (A general strategy that applies to any test-taker is to shield out the answer choices when answering the passage-based questions, as the wrong answer choices only serve to distract—provide your own general response first before looking at and choosing among the answer choices.)\n\nTake frequent breaks. Even if I felt really good about a section I had just taken, I would always opt to take at least a short breather after that section.\n\nPro tip: There\'s a long break in the middle of the test, but realistically you probably have enough time to drink water or use the restroom after any individual section. The ETS gives you a lot of time to read the general instructions at the beginning of each section (if I recall correctly, several minutes), and you can even click the button to request extra time to read the instructions, which you can do once per section. Honestly, unless you\'re fretting to begin the next section, I don\'t see any disadvantage to taking advantage of that time to ""reset"" and clear your mind before each section, especially if the previous section was a bit more hectic than you would have liked.\n\nNote that while some of the strategies I mention above are applicable to all test-takers, some are good only if you\'re looking to get a near-perfect scaled score (and otherwise could potentially be rather poor strategies if extreme accuracy is not your limiting factor, as you might be missing questions due to the rapid pace of making multiple passes).\n*I\'m not saying it\'s not possible to get a 340 starting out with a lower score, depending on exactly how and why you got the lower score, but if you\'re starting far below a 330, shooting for a 340 starts to become less realistic and a matter of diminishing marginal returns on your time: the GRE is less important to grad admissions than the MCAT and SAT are to medical school and college admissions, respectively. Realistically, anything above a 330 is quite sufficient for admission to most top grad schools in the U.S. if your other credentials are good, especially if you\'re applying as a domestic student (though do note that many top math/engineering/physics programs desire a near-170 quantitative reasoning score as a sanity check). Even if you\'re looking to get a score in the 336-340 range, note that the grind to get from, say, a 330 to a 335 is arguably faster and less treacherous than that to get from a 336 to a 340.\n\nIf you\'re dead-set on a 340, though, I\'d start with the steps highlighted in the many excellent answers to How do I prepare for the GRE to score above 330?\n\nThere are certainly accounts of people out there who have put hundreds of hours over many months preparing for the GRE, which is certainly warranted in some cases depending on their goals, but putting in the extra month of study to improve just to a couple points is not really worth it. Do more research. Get more job experience. Learn more about the world. Eat some pie.', 'GRE consists of the following sections:\nAnalytical Writing – 2 sections or tasks\n“Analyze an issue”\n“Analyze an argument”\nVerbal Reasoning – 2 sections\n25 questions/section\nQuantitative Reasoning – 2 sections\n25 questions/section\nIt is not much difficult to score in quant. Manhattan and Kalpan are the best sources\nYour verbal ability accounts for two thirds of your score; quantitativeability accounts for the rest. To do well in GRE, you must ace thelinguistic side of the test.\nHow do you do that?\nCultivatea habit of reading extensively. Any book (my personal recommendation are the classics), magazines – TheEconomist, Reader’s Digest.newspapers – NewYork Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian(the best content lies in the editorials, and definitely not in the Page-3/entertainment section), websites and news sites (BBC has some of the finest content).\nMoving on to the Verbal Reasoning section. The finest tool you can equipyourself with, to crack this section is a vast vocabulary. Now, some of us are somehow blessed with a vast vocabulary, most of us,unfortunately, aren’t. That makes learning vocabulary our primary challenge in cracking GRE.\nHow do I build my vocabulary?\nExtensive reading helps; but this is tedious method of getting there. There is extensive literature available on GRE specific vocabulary; various sources are give you this list. Kaplan’s and Barron’s have their long and condensed lists for you.\nThebest of them all, however, is VocabSmith. (I must confess here that Irepresent VocabSmith). VocabSmith teaches you the words with meaning,usages and synonyms. VocabSmith uses the state-of-art RST algorithm,which is the most advanced learning methodology for vocabulary.Psychological research suggests that new words are learned best by repeated exposure to them, up to 4-7 times.\nVocabSmith’s RST algorithm governs your exposure to the words, in a frequency determined to be the most optimized, as suggested by proven psychological research. The algorithm further aligns this revision on the user’s difficulty in learning the words – you find a word difficult, no problem, VocabSmith revises it more for you. This way,VocabSmith ensures that your time spent on the tool maximizes your retention of the words, and associate with word usages.\nVocabSmith’s content has been prepared by veterans who’ve been in this industry for over 15 years. The list of words in each of its courses have been carefully chosen, so as to optimize your preparation for GRE. You could choose from the following three packages:\nGRE Complete – For the marathoners. This course contains the complete GRE word list of 3500+ words.\nGRE High Frequency – For the medium-distance runners. This course contains a thoroughly-researched list of 1000+ words repeated often in GRE\nGRE Ultra High Frequency – For the sprinters. This course contains 400+ words that have appeared the most often in GRE.\nItis available in both Android and iOS versions.

Read his first, and I’ll add on more.\nVerbal:\nYou are probably not going to score 340 without a large vocabulary. If you have a long time to prep, start reading lots of non-fiction and intellectual new sources like the Economist. If you have a weak vocabulary and short time to prepare, memorize an available list, but set your sights a bit lower.\nProcess of Elimination is super important. Particularly when you need to pick two words that both fit the sentence *and* match. On the tricky questions, they like to throw in words that fit the sentence but do not have a pair. Eliminate them.\nTone is very important. Look for positive and negative words and make sure your answer matches.\nQuantitative:\nYou should have enough time to go through each question twice. Try to solve the problem in two different ways to make sure your answers are consistent and you didn’t miss a trap.\nIt’s very important to back-solve. Almost all questions you can plug the answer in to solve for the initial conditions. This can be one of your two way.\nUse shortcuts to narrow down choices. eg. in a triangle the third side will always be less than the sum of the other two. Or the angles will sum to 180. On some questions, only one answer will meet these basic criteria and you won’t need to solve the problem completely.\nTest Day:\nDrink plenty of water.\nIn your practice tests, you should be finishing the sections in less than 15 minutes. Use this time to get up, perhaps take a water/bathroom break and then review the questions in a fresh mindset (note: if you have trouble completing the sections in < 20 minutes, a 340 is probably unrealistic).\nTry and book your exam on a date/time when you will be in a good mental space (eg. not right before a holiday, morning/afternoon, Monday vs. Friday. When are you sharpest?)\nDress comfortably but professionally. I found that wearing business casual put me in the right mind set. A psychological hack to put yourself in a focused, business-oriented mindset.\nUse the ‘mark’ function to mark questions you should triple-check.\nDon’t bother memorizing school codes. You can look up the school at the end of the test and if you really can’t find it, you can pay to send it afterward.\nIf you are applying to business school, write the GMAT first. I found the Reading Comprehension, Critical Reasoning and Quantitative Problem Solving to be tougher on the GMAT. If you prepared for the GMAT, you will have to do little prep in these areas for the GRE.']"
How good is a GRE score of 302?,16 Answers,['GRE Score\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nHow good is a GRE score of 302?'],"['Universities look at a candidates complete profile. Let’s take your case as an example since you have done a great job in providing most of your details. What do universities look at when evaluating a profile:\nQuantitative scores: Grades, GRE scores etc. Your latest grade, 67% in BE, is an average score. Your GRE score, all sections are on the lower side. For MS in any engineering or science program, universities place importance on Quants, then AW, then verbal. So score above 163–165 on Quants, at least 4.0 on AW and above the minimum required for verbal (which should be listed on the universities website) or at the very least 1 standard deviation below the average (some universities list average scores instead of minimum). I recommend reading GRE Scores - The Good, Bad and Ugly for in depth insights on GRE scores.\nRanking of your bachelor’s university: A 60% in IIT is valued much more than 90% in a Sido Kanhu Murmu University type university.\nSOP: This is the heart of your application. A well written statement can get you into your top choice university. A well-thought out SOP has the following qualities:\nUnique. It has to be about you. Your story, your goals, your personality should shine through, reasons why you want to apply to this particular university etc. Uniqueness gives rise to…\nAuthenticity. Be genuine. Don’t make up stories or challenges you overcame. Authenticity also comes from…\nDepth. When thinking about your goals, the reasons you want to apply to a university, focus on depth. The more you think about reasons for each and every decision, the more authentic it will be. Keep asking yourself questions. Don’t settle on an answer till you’re satisfied with it. Get to the point where no one can break through your reasoning for any decision. With depth comes…\nSpecifics. Answer each question with details. If you can’t answer a question, research.

Write crisp sentences, get your point across quickly and move on to the next point.\nI have a detailed blog post about the must haves in your statement of purpose.\nLOR: Just like a restaurant has to have great reviews before you eat there, so do you to get into a good university. It seems that you have this covered.\nWith all this in mind (and without reading your SOP), I think USF, ASU and Northeastern are safe choices. You’re on the borderline for UF and UTD.\nGood luck!\nEdit:\nAdditionally, a score of 302 for your GRE is on the lower side. Your best bet is to increase your GRE scores above 310 or 315.\nI’ve captured this sentiment in depth here! Enjoy!', ""Thanks for A2A\nA GRE score of 302 can take you places...maybe not the Ivy Leagues and the top 10 grad-schools, but places nonetheless!\nWhat Universities Can I Target with GRE: 300-310?\nTo start with, here are a few of the ‘achievable’ universities you can target with a GRE score in the range of 300-310:\nTexas A&M Kingsville\nSUNY Buffalo\nSUNY Stony Brook\nUT-Dallas\nUT-Arlington\nSJSU\nThe University of Louisiana - Lafayette\nIllinois Institute of Technology - Chicago\nRochester Institute of Technology\nUniversity of Houston\nDownload GRE Cutoff scores for top 35 US Universities here\nBut does this mean you can’t target the TOP 25 with your score?\nGRE score requirements are not concrete, and there are several instances of students who land above-average or top admits, despite a GRE score not even close to the university average score of admitted students. We’ll analyze a few of those profiles at the end, so if that’s what you’re looking for, just scroll to the bottom of the answer!\nLet’s now find out how good a 300-310 GRE score is in terms of both percentiles and required GRE scores of some popular programs.\nIs 302 a Good Score?\nThe truth is, the universities don’t look at your total GRE score, but the individual scores obtained in the Verbal, Quant, and even the AWA section - though it’s marked separately. Hence, how good your score is, depends on these factors:\nYour Verbal & Quants percentile scores\nThe GRE score required for that program/university.\nCheckout our eBOOK on 5 Techniques to score 170 in Quants\nLet’s talk percentiles. Percentiles are a measure of what percentage of other GRE takers have a score lower than you. Hence, the higher your percentile, the better your chances!\nETS, the organization that conducts the GRE calculates percentiles separately for Verbal, Quant, and AWA.\nAs you mentioned, you have a 144 and 158 on your Verbal and Quants section respectively.\nTake a look at your individual score percentiles below (source: ETS)\nDecoding the Data - What matters more for you?\nBroadly speaking you need a higher score on the section more closely related to your field. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) Courses like Computer Science, in your case, place more emphasis on a higher Quants percentile whereas Ph.D. courses in thesis-based subjects often require a higher verbal score!\nNoticed how the Verbal percentiles are higher than Quant percentiles throughout?\nThe difference between verbal and quants scores is especially more pronounced in countries such as India where more students score better in the Quants section owing to a higher priority given to developing mathematical skills coupled with the engineering background that most test-takers share! Thus, to get a higher Quants percentile, you’d need a higher Quants score than Verbal!\nAiming for a high Quants Score? Then Download GRE Quant Formula Book for a perfect 170 Score\nWhat is a Good Percentile?\nRoughly speaking, any score above the 50% mark is considered good, with a percentile above 70% considered excellent!\nThis means, a score of 151 or more on Verbal and 153 or more in Quant is considered good. Anything below that and it means that most test-takers scored higher than you.\nGiven the fact that your Quants score is 158, and you’re applying to a STEM course, you’re already at an advantage - with your score being higher than almost 70% of test takers!\nNow, coming to what you really wanted to know…\nWhat is the BEST you can target with your score?\nYour admits are only as good as your profile is - of which your GRE is JUST one part!\nThe internet is jam-packed with the score requirements of universities and the average GRE scores of students admitted.\nBut does that mean that these boundaries are set in stone?

How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,100+ Answers,['Freelancers\nFreelance Tips and Hacks\nFreelancing\nHow do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?'],"['A freelancer\'s guide to taking over the world!\nEstablish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.\nEducate yourself:It\'s a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.\nGet organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn\'t have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.\nAnother thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.\nKnow your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.\nManage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.\nMy suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.\nThe golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - Expenditure\nGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.\nMarket your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It\'s ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!\nYou could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your terms\nKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!\n- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms', 'It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.\nYou’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements.

That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:\nFreelancer - Hire & Find Jobs\nUpwork\nCraigslist\nPeoplePerHour\n99designs\nGuru\nEngineerBabu\nHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline.

Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.\n2. Build a Perfect website\nAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.\nWhile building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:\n20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.\nShow diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.\nInclude your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.\nIf you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.\n3. Brand Yourself\nOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-\nWhether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.\nAlong with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.\nYour logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.\nMost importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.\nThe domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.\nBecome a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.\n4. Understand the project requirement carefully\nAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:\nThe work that client is offering you is his/her dream.\nYour client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.\nBe reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.\nThe client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.\nDon’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.\nAlways give very clear and genuine project timeline.\nUnderstand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.\nNote down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.\nNever steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.\nAll the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.\n5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own services\nOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.\nThere are three different strategies that can be opted for are-\nCost-plus pricing\nYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.\nMarket Rate pricing\nBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.\nValue driven pricing\nIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.\n6. Timely Communication with Clients\nCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.\n7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadline\nBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.\nSince you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.\n8. Always deliver more than Expected\nLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”\nKeeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.\nThe only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.\n9. Be Professional\nWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-\nStarting date of project\nThe project’s deadline\nMilestones\nFunctionalities\nSchedule meeting in prior\nMake the clear timeline of deliverables.\nProfessionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–\nKeep Your Personal Life limited to yourself\nYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.\n It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.\nCharge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.\nSchedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.\nIf some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.\nBuild the right association.\nIt is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.\nFollow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.\nDon’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.\nBe positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.\n10. Networking and Relationship with Clients\nBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..\nSome useful techniques to grow your network.\n1. Increase your Social Media Network\n Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.\n 2. Attend events\n You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.\n3. Speak at events\n Better than attending events become a speaker at one or two. Speaking at such events increases your credibility networking opportunities and hence you will be more visible than other fellows present in the event.\n 4. Connect with ex-colleagues and ex-clients\n Keep in touch with your college colleagues and clients will help you in getting new work from them. Since they know what you are Good at.\n 5. Connect at co-working space\n You can share your desk with other freelancers from another field; this is the best way to enrich knowledge and network.\n All points listed above reinforces you to become a freelancer, your perfect profile generation for freelance success and helps you in becoming your own boss with a promising career ahead.', 'For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.\nThat doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.\nBut I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.\nFor example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:\n“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”\nTo that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.\nOf course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.\nHere are a few:\nYou learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.\nThere are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.\nIt’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.\nYou get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?\nFreelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.\nBottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.\nAnd you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.\nIf you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.\nOn the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.\nOnce you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.']"
I made a monumental mistake in my SOP for graduate school by writing the same university's name in the middle of the SOP. Do I have no chance?,11 Answers,"[""Master of Science Degree Admissions and the Graduate Record Examination\nGraduate Record Examination Advice\nMaster of Science Degree Admissions\nThe GRE and Postgraduate University Admissions\nGraduate School Admissions Advice\nMaster's of Science Degree Advice\nCollege and University Admissions Advice\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nCollege and University Admissions\nI made a monumental mistake in my SOP for graduate school by writing the same university's name in the middle of the SOP. Do I have no chance?""]","['I can offer an anecdote of advice.\nI was told that for my SOP I should include a customized paragraph about each school. This included a short list of multiple professors at that school that I wanted to work with, including names of those who I had already been in contact with prior to submitting my application, and reasons why I thought we would be a good fit. I do think this helped my application because it showed that I was prepared to work with multiple professors (you never know who you might not be compatible with) and it shows that I had been thinking about grad school for a while. Now, you\'ve already submitted your application so if you didn\'t do this, I wouldn\'t worry. Plenty of people don\'t and make it into grad school with just strong letters and a decent CV. For myself, I needed a little more.  This can just serve as advice to other readers who might be looking for application advice.\nSo in my application to University of California San Diego I found out after I submitted that I had put in my final sentence, ""and that\'s why Univeristy of Washington will be a good fit for me."" Or something to that effect. Oops. Well, to make it short I got accepted to UC San Diego. It seemed they didn\'t care so much. Now, as I mentioned, I had written about professors from UC San Diego, so that may have helped, but I still wrote Washington at the end.  It\'s likely professors reviewing your application understand what being busy is like, and they know you might want to go to their school, even if it\'s maybe not your first choice. They can still tell if you\'re a good candidate and will overlook the tiny error for a record of good research, a genuine interest in your field, and some good letters of recommendation.\nGood luck!', ""I've done graduate admissions in CS for several years. Please don't worry about it. If your reader is going to reject you for just this reason, you don't want to go there anyway. I think most readers will realize you have applied to multiple schools. Mistakes happen all the time - this is a minor one."", ""There's a reason that, in my recommendation letter advice article, I tell people to not customize their letters unless they really have something specific to say. The same applies to statements. At best, simply mentioning the name of the university tells me you know how to use a merge program. At worst, it tells me you don't even know how to use one.\nFortunately, certain kinds of merging are not considered vital skills for computer science graduate students. And guess what: every year we see a dozen different statements or recommendation letters that make exactly this mistake.\nIt will make the admissions committee members chuckle and shake their heads, and probably wonder a bit about your attention to detail. But it's not lethal; it's not in itself a cause for rejection."", ""Hi,\nI don't mean to dishearten you - but this is a common admissions committee gripe - the fact that applicants use a one-size-fit-all SOP and sometimes don't even realize they haven't changed the school name.\nGiven that U Penn's November 15th deadline, CMU's December 3 deadline, UCSD's December 15 deadline and UIUC's December 15 deadline have gone by a while back, communicating with the school for changing your SOP might not yield results. All the same, I would suggest you connect with admissions and ask if you will be allowed to replace your SOP because of a typo. Given that JHU has an application submission deadline of Feb 15 - I am most optimistic about this working at JHU.\nGood Luck!""]"
How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,100+ Answers,['Freelancers\nFreelance Tips and Hacks\nFreelancing\nHow do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?'],"['A freelancer\'s guide to taking over the world!\nEstablish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.\nEducate yourself:It\'s a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.\nGet organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn\'t have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.\nAnother thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.\nKnow your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.\nManage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.\nMy suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.\nThe golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - Expenditure\nGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.\nMarket your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It\'s ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!\nYou could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your terms\nKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!\n- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms', 'It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.\nYou’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements.

Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.\nMANAGING NETWORKS\nLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department.

Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.\nTHE ADVENTURE RIDE\nNow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!\nStart looking out for jobs.

So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.\nThis answer is a part of my blog, read it here.\nIf you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.\nPlease do let me know your suggestions and feedback.\nI’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.', 'Let’s start step by step:\n1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.\nIf you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:\nFreelancer - Hire & Find Jobs\nUpwork\nCraigslist\nPeoplePerHour\n99designs\nGuru\nEngineerBabu\nHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.\n2. Build a Perfect website\nAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.\nWhile building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:\n20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.\nShow diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.\nInclude your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.\nIf you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.\n3. Brand Yourself\nOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-\nWhether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.\nAlong with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.\nYour logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.\nMost importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.\nThe domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.\nBecome a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.\n4. Understand the project requirement carefully\nAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:\nThe work that client is offering you is his/her dream.\nYour client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.\nBe reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.\nThe client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.\nDon’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.\nAlways give very clear and genuine project timeline.\nUnderstand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.\nNote down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.\nNever steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.\nAll the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.\n5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own services\nOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.\nThere are three different strategies that can be opted for are-\nCost-plus pricing\nYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.\nMarket Rate pricing\nBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.\nValue driven pricing\nIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.\n6. Timely Communication with Clients\nCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.\n7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadline\nBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.\nSince you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.\n8. Always deliver more than Expected\nLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”\nKeeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.\nThe only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.\n9. Be Professional\nWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-\nStarting date of project\nThe project’s deadline\nMilestones\nFunctionalities\nSchedule meeting in prior\nMake the clear timeline of deliverables.\nProfessionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–\nKeep Your Personal Life limited to yourself\nYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.\n It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.\nCharge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.\nSchedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.\nIf some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.\nBuild the right association.\nIt is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.\nFollow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.\nDon’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.\nBe positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.\n10. Networking and Relationship with Clients\nBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..\nSome useful techniques to grow your network.\n1. Increase your Social Media Network\n Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.\n 2. Attend events\n You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.\n3. Speak at events\n Better than attending events become a speaker at one or two. Speaking at such events increases your credibility networking opportunities and hence you will be more visible than other fellows present in the event.\n 4. Connect with ex-colleagues and ex-clients\n Keep in touch with your college colleagues and clients will help you in getting new work from them. Since they know what you are Good at.\n 5. Connect at co-working space\n You can share your desk with other freelancers from another field; this is the best way to enrich knowledge and network.\n All points listed above reinforces you to become a freelancer, your perfect profile generation for freelance success and helps you in becoming your own boss with a promising career ahead.', 'For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.\nThat doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.\nBut I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.\nFor example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:\n“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”\nTo that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.\nOf course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.\nHere are a few:\nYou learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.\nThere are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.\nIt’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.\nYou get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?\nFreelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go.

When will graduate schools drop the GRE requirement?,4 Answers,['Graduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Education\nGraduate School Admissions\nColleges and Universities\nWhen will graduate schools drop the GRE requirement?\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-problem-with-the-gre/471633/'],"[""It should just be a matter of time.\nThe University of Chicago just dropped requirements for SAT or ACT scores for undergraduate admission. And the GRE correlates less to grades than the SAT does.\nSo let’s be clear. The GRE does not actually measure the ability of a student to complete graduate school work. Look at the data:\nIn one ETS study (ETS is the company that actually administers the test) of 12,000 test takers, the exam accounted for a mere 9% of the differences (or variation) among students' first-year grades. Undergraduate grades proved to be a stronger predictor of academic success, explaining 14% of the variation in graduate school grades (ETS, 1998).\nAn independent non-ETS study found an even weaker relationship between test scores and academic achievement - just 6% of the variation in grades could be predicted by GRE scores (Morrison, T. & Morrison, M. (1995).\nWish as we may, numerous academic studies show little - if any - meaningful predictive validity of GRE scores for graduate school achievement. See the exhaustive list of references below.\nAnother response here notes that “the role of tests like the GRE is to assess the aptitude of students to do the academic work.” But again, it doesn’t accomplish this.\nSome admissions people will say that “ … but the scores add information to the applicant profile.” Yet adding any variable to the application might do a better job at this. A physics grade. A math grade. A project in art. The make of one’s car. The care one gives to their ailing grandparent. The distance one runs in 10 minutes. If it was so clearly adding information, we should be able to clearly articulate what information it’s adding, and why.\nThe question shouldn’t be whether it adds “information” to an applicant, because any bit of information accomplishes that. Instead, admissions committees should ask: are the metrics we’re demanding our candidates have actually adding meaning to our understanding of this applicant? And is this effort we’re asking them potentially adding meaning to society?\nThink about it. Would we better off if we asked these students to volunteer 100 hours to solving our nation’s worsening homeless problem, rather than wasting 100 hours and thousands of dollars preparing for these tests? What are we telling our youth? That dumping $3,000 into test prep knowledge - very expensive knowledge which instantly becomes worthless to the individual and society immediately upon leaving the test center - is more important than people suffering in our society?\nCertainly some subject-related tests like the MCAT focusing around subject matter, so might be more relevant there. TOEFL or other language tests certainly measure something, so I’m not advocating getting rid of those. But let’s be clear of the facts presented so far: the tests themselves have not been proven to reflect meaningful aggregate aptitude.\nSo why do graduate schools still use them? A few hunches, some of which may be controversial, but my best guess:\nPerpetuate existing racial or income-related biases. This is obviously very controversial, but look at the facts: whites and Asians tend to be the highest earners in the U.S (American Median Incomes By Race Since 1967 [CHART]). And most educational institutions want money. So which money trough will these thirsty educational institutions look first? Some schools are “need-blind”, others are “need-aware”, but regardless of what type of school you are, there are positive incentives for any institution in these cash-strapped days to get good access to rich students with fat checkbooks. However, at the same time, these colleges can’t blatantly use “race” or “income” as a variable for acceptance, right? That would be too … well … racist. So colleges then scratch their head and say: how can we “filter” based on race without actually coming out and saying we’re filtering based on race? Is there any metric that we use that actually predicts incomes and race - but obfuscates this fact behind it’s stated public intention of measuring so-called “aptitude”? The GRE seems to be the perfect tool to hide behind. It doesn’t predict your first year grades, but it actually does do a pretty good job predicting how rich you are, and therefore which race you come from.\nApplicant narrowing. These tests clearly help overwhelmed admissions committees divide the huge number of applicants into pools for assessment. Having been on one of these committees, I understand this need. But as the studies below suggest, the predictive validity of the GRE is about the same as the distance of one’s ability to throw a tennis ball. Schools and departments misuse this data routinely, causing many good candidates to get filtered out. If it’s not a valid measure, then it shouldn’t be used. Period.\nProfits for the industry. The test-making oligopoly are currently the only game in town dominating the U.S. standardized test market, a market worth $2 billion. These companies have ample incentive in supporting the current test-centered status quo for the simple reason it keeps them in business, and offering lucrative rewards for doing so.\nAs evidence of this, the large test making corporations - Pearson Education, ETS (Educational Testing Service), Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and McGraw-Hill — collectively spent more than $20 million on lobbying bills in U.S. states and on Capitol Hill from 2009 to 2014 (Strauss, 2015). Admittedly, this is pocket change compared to the sums being spent by roughly pharma, finance, and utility companies. But if the evidence was so conclusive that standardized tests accurately reflect aptitude for nearly all of graduate programs, what’s the purpose of spending so much on lobbying? Should testmakers really hijack our nation’s education system with such control? Does that seem fair to you in our democracy?\n“As of 2011, Gaston Caperton, the president of the College Board, nonprofit owner of SAT, was paid $1.3 million. Richard Ferguson, former executive officer of ACT Inc., made roughly $1.1 million. Meanwhile, The National Board on Educational Testing and Public Policy at Boston College reported that the value of the standardized testing market was anywhere between $400 million and $700 million.” (Rainesford, 2016)\nThe test makers know this, but they’ve also learned how to play the game well. They have successfully fooled the world (not just in America - dozens of top schools in Britain, Canada, France and others use it too) that this test is absolutely critical in adding information to your applicant, so you must use it as a standard. And yet it’s a farce. Make no mistake. Big bucks are being made off of the sweat, tears, and anxiety of the world’s youth. All while these companies get big payouts. Profits and compensation levels of this nature are so obscene that it reflects a monopoly, and both the testing companies and the prep companies are the benefactors of it.\nIt’s an outdated institution who’s usefulness was better suited for perpetuating racial biases in the 1949 post-WWII era (which it did magnificently well as data has shown in the chart above - black and Hispanic incomes have stagnated relative to whites over the five decades). It’s also very good good at extracting wealth potential from our nation’s youth to the benefit of anyone who earns a salary at a college. If I were a youth right now, I’d take to the Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn - heck even go to the streets - and protest to the gills.\nAnd is it any wonder that employers are constantly complaining about students they hire? It’s because the schools themselves are not selecting the right students from the beginning. The hardest working students are likely the ones most apt to do poorly on standardized tests in the first place. Instead of attending $3K test-prep courses, the best students / workers are the guys and girls working double-shift at Walmart to support their sick uncle or grandparent because the family can’t afford healthcare. You think they have time to study for a useless test?\nSome why am I optimistic? As barriers get broken down around different industries, I can envision a day where alternative tests or projects might be used for acceptance.\nAlternative systems are already popping up. MIT, one of the world’s top universities, has created the concept of a micro-masters degree. The idea behind it is instead of going through a lengthy and tedious application process, instead you just take the first semester of a masters degree online. This “micro” degree can be used as a professional certificate, OR - if you do well - you can use it to gain admission towards their more academic-oriented masters degree in that field. Not sure if they require the GRE still, but it’s a good step towards a better solution that reduces bias. Admit students on a provisional basis, and if they do well, then let them complete the masters. That way, you don’t bias promising students whom might have not had a good start earlier in life.\nAnother creative possibility is to assess student’s based on scenarios that they need to work out, like this company Imbellus is doing. Using computing power, AI , give students scenarios that they needs to work through, and allow them full scope - rather than a limited series of answers - to answer.\nThe fact these tests still perpetuate the system is a reflection of something deeply wrong with American society. And the rest of the Anglo world for following it. The unfortunate reality for today is that colleges’ inaction on this policy is a reflection of their values. Alternative systems exist out there, and it’s high time schools start adopting them to reduce biased in their application process.\nIt’s just a matter of time.\nArticles and Academic Research\nBoldt, Robert F.

ERIC Document No. 240 122.\nRainesford, A. (2016). The Business of Standardized Testing. The Huffington Post. The Business of Standardized Testing"", 'In my view the GRE score as used to partially determine graduate school worthiness is primarily an economic issue. Universities can use the score painlessly, i.e., they do not need to contribute much time, personnel, critical thinking from administrators/faculty, or money to receive and use the results on the GRE as a determinant in graduate school entry. I think if graduate schools truly wanted the best candidates, they’d develop their own tests and administer them, and not necessarily tests that imitate the structure of the GRE. In fact, even if the scores on the GRE were determined to have NO correlation with grad school success, I think universities would still use it. It is simply too expensive for them to devise their own rigorous means of selecting candidates. A related anecdotal example is that I know of a university department that didn’t want to spend the time sifting through all their grad school applications because faculty claimed it was too busy (the program only accepted 3–5% of applicants), so they assigned the task to current doctoral students.\nRegarding the predictive nature of the GRE for grad school success, the best study I’ve seen concluded GRE scores only predicted how well a student would do in the first six months of grad programs. Although not stated in the study, my personal analogy would be the battle readiness of American soldiers vs. German soldiers during World War II. When the U.S. entered WW II in 1941, German soldiers already had two years of combat experience. American soldiers had to adapt to warfare while German soldiers were already experienced. Within three to six months, the American soldiers were equally able. With limited budgets at many universities, there will need to be sufficient publicized research of this type until there is public pressure to limit the importance of the exam.', 'When there is something better. The role of tests like the GRE and GMAT is to assess the aptitude of students to do the academic work. They are not the only admissions criterion. Admissions managers often understand and account for the bias in the test, for example giving international applicants a handicap. But the point is not that high scores predict excellence, but that below average scores reflect lower ability to keep up with the coursework.', 'Graduate schools will never eliminate the GRE requirement because graduate admissions committees needs to be able to screen out unqualified applicants with either weak verbal, math, or writing skills, depending on the discipline of study. Most programs that don’t require math, like English and humanities pretty much ignore math scores, where usually an average score or higher is good enough. Same goes for quantitative programs, like science and engineering, they’ll for the most part ignore verbal scores but consider math and writing scores. Especially when evaluating international applicants where English is not the native language. The essay can determine whether this applicant can thrive in an English language instruction environment. I don’t believe that graduate schools today use GRE scores as a predictor of student success or measure of probability of completing the degree program. The personal statement, letters of recommendation, and interview, if required, matter so much more. I would be against eliminating the GRE as a graduate school application requirement. Some graduate schools also require GRE subject test scores, like in biology or mathematics, which are knowledge-based.']"
How do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?,100+ Answers,['Freelancers\nFreelance Tips and Hacks\nFreelancing\nHow do I start freelancing? Should I just take jobs and see what happens or take some kind of course and then proceed?'],"['A freelancer\'s guide to taking over the world!\nEstablish an online presence: The first thing to focus on before jumping into the freelancing world is to have a well established online presence to showcase your work and establish credibility. You could start with LinkedIn professional profiles. Getting recommendations could help add credentials. Blogs and a website will surely be an addition.\nEducate yourself:It\'s a very competitive world out there and to survive, ""Specialization"" is the key. It gives you a competitive edge over others and would help you kick start a successful career. Also, keep educating yourself to remain upgraded with the ""New"" in the industry.\nGet organized: As a freelancer, you wouldn\'t have an office or a team to work with, getting distracted is easy. So time management and getting organized should be a priority. The first thing to do here is to set up an office away from your comfort area, could be a corner in your room or a separate study and run a business like a business.\nAnother thing to focus on here is how to manage your time between different projects. Our suggestion would be to be selective in the ones you pick up while not overburdening yourself. Take some time out to brainstorm, think about how to market yourself and make personal time.\nKnow your worth: Never undersell yourself. There will always be people who could do the work for less money, but you can never make a living that way. You need to know your worth and be focused on why your services justify the fee you charge. Be selective and do not pick projects that pay lesser than what you feel you deserve.\nManage your expenses: With a fixed salary coming in and employers taking care of your taxes, you would need to take special care of your expenses as soon as you enter the freelancing space.\nMy suggestion would be to save before you spend for the dry spell. Use certain book keeping apps available on the internet like Easy Book to track all your incomes, expenditures and taxes.\nThe golden rule to follow here would be Expenditure = Income - Savings, rather Savings = Income - Expenditure\nGet a contract in place: If you really want to get started as a freelancer you need to learn to love paperwork. It is highly advised to get a contract in place before you opt for any freelance project. A contract would not only ensure that both you and the client are on the same terms and the nature of the work but also provide you with legal protection in the event of any mishap.\nMarket your skills:Finally, when you are ready to go out in the market, you will need to promote yourself well and work on networking skills to reach potential clients. You could start with networking on LinkedIn by joining industry specific communities or you could join Flexing It\'s ever growing skill community to assist you in chasing your dream!\nYou could also grab our help in getting you connected with interested organizations by simply registering with us on Talent on Demand, Work on your terms\nKeep trying and do NOT GIVE UP!\n- See more at: Talent on Demand, Work on your terms', 'It’s good to know that you want to be a freelancer or you’re considering it as an option along with your college or regular job.\nYou’re someone who doesn’t want to work in one of those ‘normal companies’ coming in for campus placements. You find the regular job awful and so you’re looking for something different. Maybe, Freelancing on a part-time or full-time basis.\nYou’re not a person who’s willing to do ordinary things. People might call you crazy but that’s the same they said about Einstein, Henry Ford too.\nYou have a desire to be independent, being your own boss or building a personal brand. This seems attractive but one has to fight and work tirelessly for it.\n You may often think that being a freelancer at your home clients will come right away to your door.

Offer to work with your peers, friends and nonprofit organizations for free.\nKeep a close look at people already in the industry and look up to their work. Develop a hobby and a habit in your work, it’ll play a huge role.\nMANAGING NETWORKS\nLike any other field, freelancing is all about networking. Go reach out to all your contacts and professional networks and let them know about your decision. Unlike the popular notion of ‘Burning Bridges’, you’ve to nurture your professional network. Don’t be surprised if your first job as freelancer comes from your previous employer or the college head of the department. Find a mentor in the network; ask them to review the work/ dummy projects and give feedback.\nNow that you have skills and network you’re closer to work as a freelancer.\nBEING THE BRAND\nThe best thing about being a freelancer is: ‘Your Identity is Your Brand’.\nYou need to create an online presence which will help your potential clients to reach out. Make sure they’re aware of what you’re offering and what’s special about it. You need to update all the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora etc accordingly. Provide your contact information, a website or a blog with your portfolio. Add few references that can help. Get your business cards and be ready to talk about the work you do and yourself more often.\nLearn some basic marketing and accounting skills. Talk to friends who are already making money through freelancing.\nTHE ADVENTURE RIDE\nNow the Brand is ready and just to be launched!\nStart looking out for jobs. This might be a slow-moving process, instead of getting stressed introspect your offers.\nAt first work on project/job expecting limited or no money at all. This is to just make connection sharpening your skills and showcasing your talent. These resources might be helpful to start off: Upwork, Guru, Elance, PeoplePerHour, Freelancer, Craig list;\nOnce you have built a quality portfolio and demonstrated your work it’s time to hunt big offers. Serve the clients with generosity, build a rapport. Businesses will start taking you seriously about your specialization.\nYour career will see a boost. In the long run, you can either be choosy about your project or take projects in volumes, both are keys to success. With time, you’ll be able to create a Brand which clients and businesses will look up to.\nFinally, keep up the good work and regularly meet other freelancers, talk them about your business. Use calling more often than emailing to a client. These things will give your brand a personal touch and also avoid the feeling of isolation.

The best thing is you can take a break whenever you want and use the time to develop or acquire new skills. Ultimately, it’s an adventure trip where you decide your path and enjoy it. So, it’s your life, Make It Worth.\nThis answer is a part of my blog, read it here.\nIf you like my answer please Upvote and share with others.\nPlease do let me know your suggestions and feedback.\nI’m Anshuman Agrahari, Co-founder of InternStreet.', 'Let’s start step by step:\n1.Register yourself on some Freelance Websites.\nIf you’re just a newbie, you may not have that large of a network. That’s pretty cool because there are plenty of freelance websites and job boards available to help freelancer find a job. Registering on these websites gives you an opportunity to connect to the large community of clients as well as other freelancers for collaboration. Some of the well-known job boards and freelance websites are:\nFreelancer - Hire & Find Jobs\nUpwork\nCraigslist\nPeoplePerHour\n99designs\nGuru\nEngineerBabu\nHere you can interact with the clients to discuss and explore the project, fix up your budget and project timeline. By joining these online portals like Upwork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Guru, EngineerBabu, TalkFreelance, you will get access to millions of jobs posted on a daily basis. Additionally, most of the above-listed website helps you in growing your network. The only thing you need to do is to register and make your profile as much attractive as you can.\n2. Build a Perfect website\nAnother factor which helps you in targeting the good clients and freelance projects is creating an attractive website which highlights your key skills and portfolio. A good website is the most inexpensive way to advertise your work and to reach out to the potential clients. It aids you with showcasing your past work done. Remember, a portfolio in your website is like the aroma of the flowers, a way to attract clients and gaining attention. Displaying detailed portfolio helps in decision making and influences the client to work with you.\nWhile building your portfolio, keep the following points in mind:\n20 % of your work will draw 80% of your business. So, show the projects that you’re most proud of and believe that represents your best work.\nShow diversity in your work. Clients always look versatility in work. At times they tend to find one stop solution for their multiple works.\nInclude your contact information so that it becomes easier for clients to get in touch with you.\nIf you are looking for a way to build your portfolio impactful, working for free with a non-profit organisation is a great way. This adds magic to your portfolio and will give you an edge over other freelancers.\n3. Brand Yourself\nOne of the major factor which adds a star in freelance success is, how you effectively brand yourself. Branding Yourself is the best way to reach out to the millions of your potential clients. It helps you in increasing your conversion rate and win the client trust. Some of the key points are-\nWhether you choose your name or business name, you should be able to create a brand for yourself.\nAlong with the business name you could have your own logo which can be placed across different mediums.\nYour logo could simply be your initials in a unique font that would be placed on your website, social media accounts, and invoices.\nMost importantly, you need to have a website where you can showcase your portfolio, share references, your achievements and promote your services. You can also mention some of the big names among your clients.\nThe domain name of your website should be easy to remember (your name would be the easiest place to start), easy to spell and describes what you do. In simple words, a name should be self-explanatory.\nBecome a freelancer is easy, but it won’t be fruitful until you make yourself a brand in your community. Ultimately Branding yourself makes it easier to stand out. It helps in showcasing your professionalism and hence gives you the opportunity to convert more clients and generate more business out of your network.\n4. Understand the project requirement carefully\nAmong all points mentioned, requirement elicitation is important of all. Breaking all the communication barriers you need to analyse the problem domain of the client and provide a sustainable solution to it. If the client has an only rough idea of the project, you need to provide them with the pathway so that it can be converted as a successful freelance project. A client may present a real life problem for which you may need an on field experience to resolve it. The client may be completely from another field and won’t understand the technicalities; you need to educate them about the best possible solution. Keep following things in mind while gathering requirement of a freelance project:\nThe work that client is offering you is his/her dream.\nYour client may present an idea where practical implementation may be complicated, instead of declaring it as “It won’t work”, you should give a possible solution. Use positive words like ‘and’ rather than ‘but’.\nBe reliable. He is looking for a remote team in you to work on the project. For that duration, you are not only a freelancer, but you are also going to be his/her team in all aspects.\nThe client is sitting remotely, so it’s your responsibility to make each and everything very clear.\nDon’t cheat. If you can’t work on the required technology, don’t manipulate and make false commitments.\nAlways give very clear and genuine project timeline.\nUnderstand the project and its demographics properly and offer the best suggestion to the clients that you garnered from your long years of experience.\nNote down or save the requirements, and always make minutes of the meeting whenever you have a discussion with the client.\nNever steal their thunder by using their ideas without giving them credit.\nAll the above suggestion will help you in removing clutter involved due to different locations, language barrier, the difference in time zones. Above all this could be the foundation of your long-term relationship with your client.\n5. Determine the legitimate cost for your own services\nOne of the major factor, whether a client will give you a chance, depends on the cost you quote for your service. Always try to be genuine while stating a price. Being a freelancer, you have an added advantage that you don’t have any overhead cost so that you can offer very competitive and a reasonable quote to the client. This will help in converting more and more references.\nThere are three different strategies that can be opted for are-\nCost-plus pricing\nYou could simply determine the expenses involved in producing a product and then add a little extra amount to it so that you can turn a profit. This is a popular, and relatively easy way.\nMarket Rate pricing\nBy figuring out how much other freelancers in your industry are charging it gives you a rough estimate of what, and how, to charge clients. Though the location has a major impact on market rates.\nValue driven pricing\nIn value driven pricing the client pays for what they believe the service is worth. However, you must also make sure that you live up to expectations. Before quoting a price, always research about the clients. It might be possible that the client has great potential. One project and relation can change your business game altogether.\n6. Timely Communication with Clients\nCommunicate frequently with your clients. Communication not only prevents errors but also helps in building an understanding. Be up-front with a client and explain to them what can be done and when it can be accomplished. Being a freelancer you have to be flexible with the clients. Some of the communication tools include Nimble, contactually, Hangout and Skype. Make arrangements to remove communication and time zone gap. Keep informing about the changes you made in the project.\n7. Manage project effectively and meet the deadline\nBeing a freelancer, you are your own boss, so you need to be organised while planning out your project. One of the best places to start is by using a Google calendar that has important deadlines or meeting dates with clients. Scheduling and managing your project can be difficult without maintaining records. This can be done effectively by using various Project management tools like Basecamp, LiquidPlanner, Projecturf, Wrike, and Project Bubble that can help keep you on track with a project. While you are engaged in this process, don’t forget to schedule time for promoting your brand, touching base with clients, and handling tasks like managing your account. As you are one man army, don’t forget to arm yourself with all the required tools.\nSince you are not confined to any pressure of manager and environment. You need to push yourself to keep working in spite of the distractions present. You should fix up time duration to work every day. This will help you in a work routine and will help you estimating project timeline. Schedule meeting once in a week. It will help you keep the work in pace with perfection. Pro-activeness and strong understanding can plant a long term relation with the clients.\n8. Always deliver more than Expected\nLarry Page, Co-Founder of Google quoted that “People will always prefer your services if you deliver more than expected.”\nKeeping this philosophy in mind, always give your best to satisfy your client. Don’t provide less than you promised. Act with integrity on what you stated as you can accomplish. Your commitment is commitment unless there is some major catastrophe. If you are delivering more than the mutually finally price, ask clearly for increment in cost without any hesitation.When you leave clients delighted with your services they will not only prefer your services in future but also will refer your service to others. Moreover, they will review your service on your website, your social media channels and other platforms; good feedback will help you in getting more work and referrals.Keep upgrading yourself with new Languages, design principles and new fashion in the world of technology. All this will help you in adding more and more freelance work in your portfolio.\nThe only thing that you need to keep in mind deliver what you committed and in the given timeline. Update regularly, convey the work progress and deliver best that you can.\n9. Be Professional\nWhile communicating, requirement gathering and deciding the cost, professionalism will always help you in making things easy. When working with a client both the parties need to be on the same page. A written contract is a good idea, and it should include all the information related to the project. It is very important for freelance success to handle project very professionally in the absence of organisational structure. Following points will make you sound professional to the clients, like-\nStarting date of project\nThe project’s deadline\nMilestones\nFunctionalities\nSchedule meeting in prior\nMake the clear timeline of deliverables.\nProfessionalism is not only limited to written contract, other factors which reflect your professionalism include–\nKeep Your Personal Life limited to yourself\nYour bad day, family and health issues, distractions and depressions should be finite to yourself. Above mentioned should not affect your professional life.\n It is self-understood that you should dress decently to impress your client whether it is face to face meeting or just a video call.\nCharge on the basis of written and mentioned requirements.\nSchedule meeting and made yourself available at that point of time.\nIf some extra charges are incurring, made it clear to client upfront. Take his/her permission before moving ahead.\nBuild the right association.\nIt is essential to associate yourself with right pursuits, people and organisations so that you will be helped in future.\nFollow and sign MOU, NDA, and other required legal formalities.\nDon’t lie about your work experience because it will shatter your carefully build a Professional image.\nBe positive, your optimism towards your work will be beneficial for your professional image.\n10. Networking and Relationship with Clients\nBeing a freelancer, you are devoid of a team to discuss the idea, brainstorm and ask for feedback. But this is your advantage in disguise; the whole world is open to a network. Build the strong network among the freelance community and make your social media channels your networking elements. Larger the network you grow and hence deeper you can dive into the sea of knowledge and business. Strong network means more business, more professional growth. Therefore, it is always important to keep expanding your connections. Alas!! This is not it, there is another important benefit, it eliminates the trial approach while finding a client. Since responses comes from people you know or network with. When you are successful in creating a good image in front of a client, you will get more work for yourself..\nSome useful techniques to grow your network.\n1. Increase your Social Media Network\n Use all the possible social media channels according to your target clients. Every country and set of demographics use different social media channels. LinkedIn is especially helpful for freelancers in getting good prospects and business associates.\n 2. Attend events\n You can join some community or clubs concerned with your field. You can show up in meet ups, global summits, and online discussion forums. Not all events are useful, so choose wisely which event you should attend.\n3. Speak at events\n Better than attending events become a speaker at one or two. Speaking at such events increases your credibility networking opportunities and hence you will be more visible than other fellows present in the event.\n 4. Connect with ex-colleagues and ex-clients\n Keep in touch with your college colleagues and clients will help you in getting new work from them. Since they know what you are Good at.\n 5. Connect at co-working space\n You can share your desk with other freelancers from another field; this is the best way to enrich knowledge and network.\n All points listed above reinforces you to become a freelancer, your perfect profile generation for freelance success and helps you in becoming your own boss with a promising career ahead.', 'For most people, the best way to start freelancing is to start freelancing.\nThat doesn’t mean you should jump in blindfolded with both feet first.\nBut I’ve found that most people try to over-prepare.\nFor example, I get a lot of emails that sound like this:\n“Danny, I’ve already completed a couple of online freelancing courses, but I still don’t feel like I’m ready to go out and get paying clients. Should I take another course?”\nTo that person, my answer is almost always no — and mind you they are usually asking if they should join one of my courses! So this should show you how strongly I feel about favoring action over study when it comes to starting your freelancing business.\nOf course, a certain amount of preparation can be a good thing. But even if you do decide to take a course, I believe there are still lots of good reasons to jump in and get your feet wet.\nHere are a few:\nYou learn more/better/faster. When I was twenty-one I read a book about winning at poker. It was a fun read, but it was only after I started playing poker that the lessons really sunk in. If I’d stuck strictly to reading until I felt “ready,” I would have slowed my progress down to a glacier’s pace.\nThere are tons of entry level freelancing gigs. My first freelancing job didn’t require any previous experience (for more details, check out my Quora answer to “How did you start freelance writing?”). Seriously, you can find tens of thousands of entry level gigs on freelancing sites like Upwork, Freelancer, and many more, every single day.\nIt’s not risky. You should definitely take a lot of courses and study extensively if you want to become a freelance bodyguard, pilot, cybersecurity consultant, or anything else where you can potentially do serious damage to yourself and others if you screw it up. But if you want to be a freelance writer, graphic designer, translator, video editor, transcriptionist, and on and on — knowing the basics and having a good attitude will go a long way.\nYou get paid to learn. Usually, you pay to learn something. For example, I’ve paid well for expert advice on swimming, investing, starting an online business, and more. But freelancing is one of the few areas of life where you can actually get paid to learn. That’s a rare and beautiful thing — why not take advantage of it?\nFreelancing isn’t about knowing everything. It’s more about being able to figure things out and learn as you go. Even the most experienced freelancers often find themselves working in unfamiliar territory — how else are they supposed to learn and grow? They can’t drop everything and take a course every time something new comes up. The best freelancers are resourceful and great at figuring things out on the fly.\nBottom line: Studying can be helpful. But in order to get results, you need to get started.\nAnd you have to start somewhere. I’d never been paid to write before … until I was.\nIf you jump in and challenge yourself, you can learn and grow very quickly, and make some money while you’re at it.\nOn the other hand, if you wait around until you feel like you know how to do everything, it’s unlikely you’ll ever get your freelancing business off the ground.\nOnce you’re ready to take the next step, you can learn everything you need to know to get started in my (free) Ultimate Guide to Getting Your First Freelance Job.']"
How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,100+ Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I plan my preparation for the GRE?'],"['GRE has three main components namely verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing. Your entire preparation process should revolve around acquiring good skills on these areas and mastering the concepts required.\nSome of the things which you can do to get the required concept clarity are\nQuantitative reasoning:\nThe best part about GRE Math is the absence of things which most of us hate in Math - The integral calculus, trigonometry and other complicated stuff. GRE Math is mostly things which you learned in junior/ high school - Things like interger properties, word problems (rate of work, speed, probability etc) which can be solved with basic common sense. Not much beyond that.\nWhat makes the GRE so tricky is the interpretation of the questions part. Once you figure out what the question is asking, the math involved is definitely easier than what you faced in your high school. In fact, it is more fun as you don\'t need to write down each and every step and show your teacher on how you arrived at your answer. You just need to pick an answer. In short, the math section just tests your ability to reason with numbers.\nVerbal reasoning:\nVerbal reasoning section is even more simple with there being only 3 question types - text completion, critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The preparation process should be fully focused on knowing specific strategies for cracking these questions rather than generic preparation advocated.\nFor example, use of flash cards for learning new words was very helpful in the earlier format of the test where antonyms and analogies were asked and there was more emphasis on rote learning of words. But, the current format focuses more on understanding not only the literal meaning of the words but also the metaphorical use of the word based on the context. For example, while the word \'opaque\' literally means \'not transparent\', it could also mean \'difficult to interpret or understand\' if used in the right context. Similarly, there are no questions asking you to identify any grammar errors. Grammar is important only for your essay writing section. Hence, it makes sense not to rely on these old fashioned methods advocated by coaching institutes but to just keep focusing on the 3 question types.\nAnalytical writing:\nAnalytical writing section asks you to write 2 essays - one on ""The Issue"" and the other on ""The Argument"". The major difference here is in the first essay you are asked to take a stand on a complex issue whereas in the second essay you are asked to dissect the logic behind an already taken stand or position.\nHow do I prepare for this? You just need to follow a simple routine and you are guaranteed to score well in this section.\nChoose - Structure - Write - Compare - Improve - Choose\nStep 1: You choose a topic where you already have some well written sample essays. You can pick these up either in the official site or from the many blogs available online.\nStep 2: Come up with a structure and an outline.\nStep 3: Write an essay by developing the structure and the outline.\nStep 4: Compare it with other essays written on the topic.\nStep 5: Rewrite your essay to improve it.\nStep 6: Go to Step 1.\n--------------------\nIf you do all of the above, you are going to definitely score well on your GRE.\nCheck out Magnus Prep\'s GRE Program if you are looking for some great mentors to help with your GRE preparation.\nCheers!', 'When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.\n\nNote: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.\n\n1. First Month: Conditioning\nAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don\'t have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nWork out (don\'t just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.\nIn parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well)\n\nFourth Week:\nTime for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don\'t forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)\nMeanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.\n\nSo, it\'s been one month now. Don\'t expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.\n\n2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull\'s Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way\nNow it\'s time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don\'t think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I\'m going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nSign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It\'s a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.\nJoin the New GRE group on Facebook. It\'s the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:\nMembers post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.\nSecondly, it\'s a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation.\nYou\'ll get access to some really USEFUL links.\nThe next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.\nThe last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don\'t forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.\nNow you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it\'s time for some real action !!\nFourth Week\nTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that\'s all its useful for. Don\'t expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms\n\n3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racer\n\nFirst Two Weeks\nPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don\'t leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don\'t, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn\'t take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I\'m telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.\n\nLast Two Weeks\nIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I\'d read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:\n\n20 online tests\n\n800Score\'s Free Full Length Revised GRE Test\n\nMyGRETutor\'s 4 free Full Length Tests\n\nKaplan\'s Free Practice Test Options for the GRE\n\nPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length test\n\nIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!\n\nOriginally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?', 'Quant - 170 Verbal- 164 AWA- 4.5/6\nI recently gave my GRE on 28th September 2017. Although I started my preparation 3 months prior to the examination I could not continue due to the fact that I am also preparing for other competitive exams. Also I was put down by Chicken pox and Typhoid for a month. Effectively I had little more than a month to prepare for the test. So I was quite surprised with the result that I got as you can see above. Here is how I prepared for my GRE test.\nStudy Material -\nMagoosh GRE prep account (most important)\nMagoosh Vocabulary builder (words flashcard app)\nManhattan prep GRE 5 lb. book of gre practice problems\nManhattan GRE Prep Reading comprehension and Essay\nOfficial Guide for GRE by ETS (all three books)\nVarious news sites such as The New Yorker , The Economist etc. ( as prescribed on Magoosh GRE blog).\nStudy Plan -\nI started my preparation at the start of the month of July . As I told earlier I am also studying for other competitive exams so I could’nt devote much time to GRE. I studied for maximum 3 hours each day. I also did’nt study according to any plan. Some days it was only vocab building by flashcards and reading articles. Some days it was practicing problems Some days divided between both. Also I watched Magoosh GRE video lessons and I can say they were very useful.\nThis is a tip for students from engineering background preparing for GRE. Don’t ignore the quantitative section even if it seems easy to you. Practice it as you would the verbal section.\nAfter recovering from my maladies I had approx 5 weeks to prepare for GRE. So I decided to tidy up my routine so\nI increased my GRE study time to 5–6 hours per day\nIn a day I would first go through my magoosh flashcards and try to learn atleast 30 new words per day and also revise a few old words. Also I made a point to read and understand atleast 2 news articles per day .\nThen I would practice quantitative for approx 1 hour . I generally used timed custom practice test in Magoosh GRE account.\nFor next 2 hours I would go through practicing the verbal section and writing essays.\nI learnt how to read the paragraphs swiftly and in detail. Again Magoosh video lessons were very important in this regard.\nUnfortunately I was not able to give any full practice test due to my surroundings but I would recommend everyone to give atleast one of them.\nMy main focus was on improving my vocab by learning new words , their meaning and context of their uses as it appeared to me to be very useful for Sentence equivalence and Text completion questions. Again and I cannot stress this enough watching Magoosh video lessons was very important.\nI practiced and practiced as much as my schedule allowed me to.\nOn the day of the examination\nReach the centre atleast 1 hour prior to the commencement of test as there are plenty of verification to be done before the examination. Also carry a water bottle with you. GRE is very attentively conducted examination and staff of testing centres are very vigilant. If you have any problem feel free to ask for their help.\nGRE is a very easy exam as you can see in my case , with a directed and concentrated approach you can score very well ( 330+) within a relatively short amount of prep time.\nBe well , Be prepared and best of luck.', 'I’ve been tutoring the GRE for a number of years. The below is inspired by the many sessions I’ve had with students, many of whom have gone on to do very well on the GRE. A lot of it is also specific to the revised GRE, which made its debut in August 2011.\n \n1. Use official material\n \nWhen preparing for the GRE, no questions prepare you better than the ones written by ETS, which is responsible for writing the questions you will see test day. As much as possible, stick to the questions in the Official Guide to the GRE so you can wrap your mind around how the test writers want you to reason.\n \nYou may not think that it makes that much of a difference, but many publishers out there have questions that require you to make certain leaps of logic—or employ questionable logic—that you will never have to do on the actual test. Then there is the fact that many questions simply aren’t as difficult or nuanced as the questions you’ll see test day. This is a problem many students encounter when using Kaplan—you are essentially taking a dumbed down version of the GRE, with often poorly constructed questions to boot.\n \n\n2. Take practice tests\n \nThere is no better way to prepare for test day than actually taking a mock test. You will train yourself to sit for three plus hours staring at a screen, as you are pummeled by an onslaught of GRE problems.\n \nIf possible, use only the official tests, found in the Official Guide to the New GRE. There are four such tests—two that comes with the book, and two that are computer-based and come with the CD that is part of the book. Stagger these out  over the four weeks you are prepping, so that there are no fewer than five days between tests and no more than ten days. If you are studying longer, you might also want to consider Manhattan GRE tests (see below).\n \nFinally, practice tests will allow you to better assess your strengths and weaknesses, and help inform your study sessions in between tests.\n \n \n3. Focus on weaknesses\n \nMake sure not to get carried away developing those areas in which you already excel. For instance, if you are generally strong at math problem solving questions, but if you dislike Data Interpretation (that’s the section with all the graphs), then the last thing you want to do is avoid that section. Instead make it a priority to become confident and effective at all questions relating to Data Interpretation.\n \n \n4. Use the best material\n \nWhile official material is clearly the best prep out there, it doesn’t necessarily provide the most effective strategies. You may want to take a look at Princeton Review for helpful big picture strategies. As for specific strategies for almost every aspect of the GRE—from permutations to convoluted paragraph arguments—the Manhattan GRE books (MGRE) are the best. MGRE also has six practice tests that mimic the actual test very well (though this more so with math than with verbal). For more practice on the online format, Magoosh also offers questions that are similar to--and often more difficult--than those found on the actual test. (I should probably mention that I work for Magoosh :))\n \nOf course there is a lot of material out there that should be avoided, especially in terms of practice content.

The prospect of moving to a strange country, meeting new friends and living independently cannot fail to excite anyone. It really comes as no surprise, then, that the Ministry of External Affairs reported that as many as 7.5 lakh Indian students are studying abroad in 2018, with the numbers only predicted to rise in the coming years.\nWith the US and Canada retaining top spots as the preferred study abroad destinations, (with 2.1 lakh and 1 lakh Indian students respectively) it goes without saying, then, that the competition for seats at universities in these two countries can get incredibly stiff.\neBook Download: USA or Canada - What’s the right choice for MS\nAdd to that the high costs of application fees, and it becomes paramount to ensure that your application quality is top-notch and helps you put your best foot forward. So how exactly can you do this, and guarantee for yourself an offer letter to your dream university? What are the various credentials that you need to focus on to build a stellar application package?\nGRE scores: Needless to say, a high GRE score is capable of working magic on your profile, and can both elevate the quality of a mediocre application, and further boost the worthiness of a quality profile. A high Verbal score proves your robust command over the English language and implicitly your ability to handle living and studying in an English-speaking country, while an excellent performance on the Quant section can unlock all kinds of rewarding scholarships and Teaching/Research assistantship positions.\n\nDownload eBook: Quant guide for a perfect 170 Score\n\nDownload eBook: Ultimate guide to crack GRE Verbal\nWhile the GRE is an indispensable part of most US university applications, that is not the case in Canada, Germany where language proficiency tests take precedence over the GRE. However, there are several reputed schools even in Canada that require or accept GRE scores as a part of graduate applications. Here’s a glimpse at some of the top Canadian universities that accept GRE scores, and their respective GRE requirements:\nDownload the ebook GRE Cutoff Scores for Top 35 Universities\nTOEFL/IELTS score: Both the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) are accepted at universities in Canada, Germany and the US, and seek to assess your command and fluency over the English language. Your ability to read, write, speak and listen comfortably in English will be gauged, and a score will be given accordingly.\n\nIn countries apart from USA, this lays a very important role in the admission committee’s mind as it gives a reflection of your communication abilities.\n\nIn the TOEFL iBT (Internet Based Test), each of the four sections will be marked between 0 to 30 for a possible total score of 120.\n\nOn the IELTS, marks are allotted between 0 to 9, with 0.5 increments. You will be given an individual band score for each skill, in addition to an overall score.\n\nA good TOEFL score is anything between 100 to 120, while a score of 7.5 and above is generally regarded as a good IELTS score. While the IELTS enjoys a worldwide acceptance, the TOEFL is generally used in the US, although all American universities also accept IELTS scores. Owing to its versatility, IELTS scores are valid in over 10,000 institutions and universities worldwide, including countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany.\nDownload eBook: A Definitive Guide for IELTS here\nAcademic GPA: One of the most crucial factors that impact your admission chances would be your GPA referred to as CGPA or percentages in a lot of Indian Institutions. Given the fact that a student’s CGPA does not completely reflect the student’s potential but to a certain extent about the faculty, college & competition in the university, it’s seen as a relative criterion. To explain in simple words, your GPA is considered as good or bad depending on your topper’s GPA. Also, each country requires your to convert your GPA to scale of 4.\n\nRead about how to convert your GPA for USA, Canada & Germany here>>\nStatement of Purpose: The Statement of Purpose, or the SOP, is a crucial ingredient to a successful application. Because universities abroad typically receive hundreds of applications with similar credentials, your SOP is your one chance to showcase your individuality and your dreams and aspirations, and set yourself apart from your peers. The SOP is commonly thought to be a replacement for the personal interview, and for that reason, it is crucial that you nail it just right. For the lowdown on how to craft the perfect winning SOP, make sure you checkout our top tips and tricks!\n\nDownload ebook: How To Craft A Winning SOP >>\nLetters of Recommendation: Written by former professors or employers, the LOR is an important testament to your intellectual and personal character, and is essentially a promise from one professor to another that you are an intelligent, diligent student, and deserving of an admit. Ideally, you should get LORs from professors who have supervised your thesis or research project, Heads of Departments, or from professors who have taught you and known you for a substantial period of time, especially if they are well-known in their field and have published extensively. You can also submit LORs from employers, although it is recommended you only do this if you’ve been out of college for a few years.\nWork and research experience: As a fresh undergraduate, you aren’t typically expected to have work experience apart from the usual internship or voluntary work. However, if you do have such experience, make sure to highlight it in your CV and SOP. Most applicants tend to apply to graduate school straight after finishing undergrad, and view work experience as a filler, but work experience not only allows you to gain a fresh perspective on the world, but also facilitates the development of new, life-defining skills, and the ability to work in and lead diverse groups of people, all of which are paramount to graduate applications. As far as research is concerned, do remember, universities in the US are vastly different from Indian ones, especially because of the onus they place on research and development, to the extent where applicants with a relatively lower GPA have won admits to top schools based purely on their excellent research experience in the past. If you have substantial research experience, it would be a good idea to get your research supervisors to write you a reference letter, and also issue you any relevant certificates. Both research and work experience are especially beneficial in making up for any shortfalls in you GPA or GRE scores, and also in getting scholarships and other aid.\nWhat are the common mistakes students make while applying?\nTime, as they say, is money, and this is especially true for MS applications, where every single day is of prime importance. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that you plan your application well in advance and follow a proper timeline so that you don’t find yourself floundering for time. So what are some of the mistakes that trip up study abroad aspirants? Let’s take a look:\nStarting GRE preparation late: Your GRE, as we mentioned, is one of the most important building blocks of your application, so ideally, you must give yourself sufficient time to start preparing for the test, so you can identify your weak points and work on them properly. You also need to have enough time so that if you find your GRE scores unsatisfactory, you can choose to rewrite it.\nInability to shortlist universities: Of course, Harvard, MIT and Caltech are the dream of millions, but realistically, is your profile compatible with the stringent requirements of these universities? Before applying, draw up a list of 8-10 universities you would like to attend, based on criteria such as GRE requirements, tuition fee, acceptance rate, past admits, alum profiles, cultural & research field compatibility with faculty etc.\n\nRemember, you will be spending quite a bit on application fees, so make sure you don’t waste time and money on schools that are unrealistically out of your league.\nDownload The SELECT Strategy to Shortlist Universities eBOOK here\nLacking the relevant details about deadlines and requirements: Universities in the US and Canada are extremely strict about the application deadlines: for instance, for fall admit, applications usually close in the first week of December of the previous year. Many aspirants often fail to take cognizance of deadlines, or neglect to send in their applications keeping in mind the time it would take to reach the US. A good idea is to note down the application deadlines of the various programs you want to apply to, well in advance. Do remember that if you are applying for a scholarship, deadlines are typically earlier. Additionally, many schools have an early bird round, which closes much before the usual deadlines. Applying in an early bird round greatly improves your chances at an offer letter, so if you’re ready, you can send in your applications right in time for that!\nConsulting unofficial/inaccurate/random websites: The internet is a quagmire of information, and it is easy to fall into a trap of misinformation if you are not careful. While researching for application information, be sure to stick to only the university’s official websites. If you are still doubtful or have any questions, be sure to write to the admissions help desk of the university to be sure.\nSending an incomplete or inadequate application: Applying overseas is not as straightforward as applying to universities in India: there is a lot more paperwork involved, such as healthcare insurance, transcripts, and visas, and in order to prevent your application from being summarily rejected, you need to ensure that your application package is complete.\n\nOverwhelmed?\nDon’t worry. Please find the MS application checklist right below to help you plan your entire application process.\nDownload the eBOOK “MS Admit: The Application Checklist” here\nWe hope you found this information useful, and now have some clarity on the various building blocks to ensuring an offer letter to your dream university.

We wish you all the best on your journey forward!', 'Dear GRE aspirant,\nDo you think that modest GRE scores and backlogs would hold back a profile? No, definitely not.\nTo help you in understanding this claim better, I have a chart* with three GREedge alumni with modest GRE scores and backlogs.\n*Data obtained from GREedge’s Admission Counselling Team\nSo, these profiles are indeed testimony to the fact that apart from your GRE score, a host of other factors determine the status of your admits.\n\nNow that you know this, I’m sure you are wondering what these factors are. Based on my experience as the Co-founder of GREedge, I would like to share them with you.\n\nBefore you get to these factors, you must know the application process to know how universities shortlist candidates. This would give you a background of what universities look for in a prospective candidate.\nA general flow of the application process would look like this:\nOver the evaluation process, Universities, in general, look to scrutinize you on a holistic basis.The evaluation begins by examining your CGPA and a host of other factors. Some of these factors include the scores of your admission requirement tests, Letter of Recommendation, Statement of Purpose/essay among the rest. So, clearly understand what universities use as a sieve in screening your application.\nMost universities have some common filters. Some of them include:\nCompetitive GPA: Once your application package reaches the university, it is immediately forwarded to the Graduate Department. The first scrutiny that is made on the application is the “test of your GPA”. Your GPA speaks volumes about your application. If you are a rank-holder or if you have a consistent academic track record, then you can definitely expect some weightage. Countries like the U.S. and Germany place a huge emphasis on GPAs. For example, Georgia Tech requires an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better to pursue a Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (MS-HCI). Though you cannot completely balance your profile with high GPA, a consistent and competitive GPA will definitely add substantial value to your profile. In addition to your GPA, the following academic factors will give your application an edge too.\nTOEFL/IELTS: A great deal of emphasis is placed on your IELTS or TOEFL score apart from your GRE score. Most universities require a good TOEFL or IELTS score. For example, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, requires a minimum of 90 points in the Internet-based TOEFL (iBT). Georgia Tech, on the other hand, for the MS-HCI program, requires a minimum of 100 in TOEFL. Universities emphasize on TOEFL/IELTS scores to determine the status of TA/RA. Further, IELTS and TOEFL scores are also taken into account in determining the quantum of your scholarships and fellowships. Keep it a point to research on the minimum requirements. A TOEFL score over 100 or IELTS score over 7 will indeed add value to your profile.\nLetter of Recommendation: The basic purpose of the Letter of Recommendation is to get a person to vouch for your credentials. This, no doubt, adds value to your profile. Ensure that you get two or three Letters of Recommendation. The Letter of Recommendation must come from someone who has been associated with you. It can be your university professor or your senior at workplace. Further, it will also add value if the person who recommends you has a PhD. So, make it a point to get a commendable Letter of Recommendation and this will indeed boost the value of your profile.\nStatement of Purpose: Your SOP is just like your personal interview with the Admission Committee. Convey all that you want the Admission Committee to know about your profile.Your Statement of Purpose must be genuine and convincing. Make it a point to highlight the drive behind your Master’s program. Answer all possible questions, such as:\n\n1. Your degree of interest in your chosen field\n2. What made you apply for the particular university\n3. Why did you choose the particular course\n\nEnsure that you don’t leave out any relevant information. Make it a point to highlight all your academic achievements and professional goals. Always remember that your SOP is as good as an interview. So, draft a compelling SOP that would persuade the Admission Committee to consider your profile.\nYou can keep the following guidelines in your mind while you draft your SOP:\nPaper Publication and Research Work: Having a good number of paper publications and research work will show that you had been in touch with the academic community. Ensure that you have your papers published in international journals. Also, if you had participated in international conferences, ensure that you highlight them. A good number of paper publications and research work will indeed add points to your applications. So, even if you have not published any papers until now, get started with it. Paper publications and research work add a high impact to your profile.\nWork Experience: Work experience will be a crucial factor in adding value to your profile. Two or three years of relevant experience will add precious points to your profile. Further, it will also be a good source for your Letter of Recommendation. Though work experience is not a mandatory requirement, relevant work experience in a reputed company will add value.\nProject and Internships: Your project and internships will definitely be considered while your application is evaluated. The degree of your practical knowledge and research acumen can be demonstrated through projects and internships. So, highlight your projects and internships. Make it a point to highlight your projects and internships in an appropriate manner.\nApart from these factors, you can certainly highlight your co-curricular and extracurricular activities too. They will also be considered since they throw light on your overall personality.Though there is no set order of priority in evaluating a candidate’s profile, you can indeed make a huge impact if you can balance out your profile. So, have a balanced profile and try not to compromise on any element. Remember that universities look for candidates with a holistic profile and not someone with unilateral strength. This will indeed make all the difference.\nAll the best!', 'Note: You can follow my Quora blog for more info about higher education abroad: https://studyabroadgre.quora.com/\nSOP Evaluation here: SOP Evaluation procedure by Mihir on Study Abroad\nPS: Before I answer anything else, I will directly answer the question asked by most of the applicants: Can my GRE compensate for poor GPA/CGPA? The answer is NO. Now read everything below:\nGRE is not a big selection criterion for MS programs.\nThe selection of a candidate for MS program is a 2 stage process:\nScreening process by the admin department: This screening process goes something like, there is a list of cut-off score or threshold values for certain selection criterion. For example, all students with GRE above 310 will be cleared, or all students with CGPA above 8.0/10.0 will be selected etc. This limit is not very strict and is flexible. TOEFL is one such criterion that will fall only and only in this screening process and not evaluated for the next one, unless you are going for TA/RA, in which case they need to evaluate your English language capability (still it will be least importance).\nSelection process by Adcom: In this process, you will be judged on your GPA, GRE score, SOP, LOR etc and is highly flexible. A student with great acads but not so good GRE can be selected over a student with perfect GRE score and average acads. It depends on your whole application file BUT certain parameters weigh more than the others.\nUsually the selection criterion goes like this (in descending order):\nAcademic GPA/CGPA/%age as well as ranking in your batch\nUndergrad university\nSOP\nResearch ex/Work ex\nGRE\nLOR\nThese other factors will vary from case to case:\nFinal Year Project\nInternship and papers\nCo/Extra-curricular\nProf Letting\nProblems people might face:\nBacklogs\nYear Gap\nPlagiarism\nSome people may disagree, but this is what I personally think, seen and experienced.\nSELECTION CRITERION:\n1. Acads are the most important parameters:\nYour GPA or %age is the prime deciding factor. If you are topper in your batch and have shown outstanding academic performance, the chances are that you will be a preferable candidate for the program. Backlogs will damage your admission chances drastically. Although you can still find cases with a lot of backlogs and people still get admission in the university. Read this link at the end of the answer those who have low confidence in this area (he had 55 backlogs; read the whole thread/story).\n2. Undergrad University:\nIf you belong to one of the top universities in your country, and you have descent acads, then you have good chances of admission. BEWARE, if you are from a top university BUT your acads are weak you will have a disadvantage compared to a student who is from a descent ranking university but high GPA. That\'s how it goes, \'Be on the top where ever you are\', that\'s something to be learned not just for MS admission process but for life as well. :D\n3. Statement of Purpose (SOP):\nI personally feel that SOP is a big deciding factor in your admission. You can be a lot of different by writing an excellent SOP. Your SOP will say a lot of thing about you silently that a strong profile will never be able to speak out. SOP tells your attitude, your ambition, your clarity of thought and your personality. These sometime overweight excellent profiles. This video will help you realize the importance of a good SOP (UMass Amherst Admission Committee):\nAlso if you want to read more about it, check the link at the end of the answer.\n4. Work/Research ex, GRE and LOR:\nI will prefer not to rank them in a strict order because they will depend on the type of program you are applying to. If you are applying for a research based program, your research/work ex and LOR will be of higher value than GRE, but if may be it is not a specifically research based MS program, then if is possible that GRE may matter more. A good GRE score will certainly help. Score above 310 is considered okay-okay.... may be descent... 320+ is desirable and good... 330+ is excellent. AWA also matters and 3.0+ is almost like mandatory... 4/4+ is good.\nWork/research ex is helpful not just during MS application process but also after completing your MS when job hunting. A relevant work ex is recommended and good, but if you have work ex in a different field than what you are going to study, no promises can be made if it will help.\nIf you are interested in doing some research work and gain some research experience before applying for MS you can apply as RA at IITs under a prof. Here are some details on that: http://www.edulix.com/forum/show...\nLORs are important mainly for PhD programs. they do add some weight to the application, but only if a prominent professor from a premier institute or a high ranking official from work place writes it. It is also important to send the LOR only using the official university/company mail id of the prof/boss, else although acceptable, they will add ZERO points to application.\nFinally I will add the uncertainty factor: LUCK. :D Although they say ""The harder I work, the luckier I get.""\nUpdate: To include all the rest of the factors involved in the admission process.\nTHESE FACTORS WILL VARY FROM CASE TO CASE:\n1. Final Year Project (FYP):\nCheck this too: Mihir Gupta\'s answer to Which kind of project should I do so that I can show it in my resume for MS in US?\nThis is also one of the important deciding factors for admission, especially for one applying for MS with thesis. It will demonstrate your ability to convert your theoretical know-how into practical engineering knowledge. Also if your project is good enough, you can get a paper out of it and publish it. Sometimes, if he admission process involves an interview with a prof who is willing to take you as RA/TA, then the FYP is very important as mos of the interview questions will be from the project.\n2. Internships and Papers:\nInternship that are usually undertaken by B.Tech students in 3rd or 4th year matter only if they project assigned to them is a good one and it they do it from a reputed firm like IISC, DRDO, or some big pvt companies. Here the important thing will also be to work for a longer time as one month\'s internship won\'t be of any use. If you work for a minimum 3 months and are also able to impress your boss such that he is willing to give you recommendation, that will be the best case scene. It is also possible to try score internships abroad in a university or a company. They are a big plus for overall profile.\nResearch papers published during the final year project or internship will help those who wish to go for MS with thesis option but not very much for students aiming for MS without thesis (MEngg; 1 yr course). The impact factor of the journal you have published your work in will be considered, but not much as adcom do not expect a high quality research work from an undergrad unless it is a direct PhD application.\n3. Co/Extra-curricular:\nThese activities will not offer you any major advantage, but will make your resume/CV look bright and show that you are involved in activities other than acads. If you do not have good acads and bad GRE, then these activities will be of zero importance, on the other hand if you profile is good and you have done some nice activities, then these will provide you an edge over student who has profile similar to yours.\n4. Prof-Letting:\nThis is useful only when you think you have good admission chances and that you want to work under a prof as RA/TA under a prof during MS. For this the credentials responsible will differ. Of course acads will still hold importance, but after that will come your work ex, research ex, papers, project and LOR. There is a method required to contact profs of the desired university. You can read all about it in the link at the end of the answer.\nPROBLEMS PEOPLE MIGHT FACE:\n1. Backlogs:\nDon\'t feel disappointed if you have had a few backlogs. Although your list of universities will be a bit different compared to the one who had no backlogs, but you still do have a good chance to succeed. For this I will again link you to this guy who had 55 backlogs and still got admit and visa as well. All you need is strong motivation, hard work and will power.\nBacklog in a core subject, the one you are selecting your specialization for MS will hurt bad, but if it is in an unrelated subject, it will probably not be that bad.\n2. Year Gap:\nIf you completed your UG in 2012 and did nothing till June 2013, then it will be called a year gap. If you worked for a major part of that year (6/6+ months) then its not probably not a year gap.\nSome year gaps are acceptable. Like you took a year off to work in an NGO or may be for (Teach For India) TFI or something like that, then it is acceptable.\nThe other case may be that you were preparing for GATE or any other exam. This will be a negative factor for your profile unless you did great in that exam and that exam somehow added to your profile (like good GATE score is valuable for German universities).\nThe third case can be that you were search for job and by the end you decided to take GRE for MS. This will have really bad effect on your profile, unless you can cover it with something valuable you might have done side by side.\n3. Plagiarism:\nThis is kind of an indirect factor that may affect your chances of admit, BUT if found guilty, you may not just receive reject from the university you applied to but also from other universities you are going to apply to. Plagiarism is a serious issue when it comes to higher studies. So my advice will be DO NOT try to copy anything.\nSo if you find my answers helpful, do endorse me for topics.\nLINKS (For any help use Edulix - Premier Site for Scholars - \'Education Crowd-Sourced\'.

PM me if you need help here.', 'TOEFL will not matter, but GRE does matter for an entry to a top MS program. More importantly, once you achieve something around 167 and above in quant and 160 and above in Verbal, even GRE does not matter. These days a lot of Indian students are applying with GRE scores of 325+, so I do not think GRE will pull you up, unless you get 335+ (but anything less than 315 will pull you down).\n\nWhat matters --\n1) CGPA (higher the CGPA better are your chances. Anything with 9 pointer above will be a good bet).\n\n2) Rank (if your university of college gives you a recognised rank then say your CGPA is 8, but still you are second in class, then it shall help your case).\n\n3) Name of the institute. Better recongized is your institute, better are your chances. For example: names such as IIT, NIT or BITS do hold value.\n\n4) Internships -- If you have internship at IIT or some other good US university, then you have brighter chances of achieving an admission. If you have internships at top multinationals (such as for CS guys microsoft, IBM labs, intel, samsung and so on) then also you can secure a good MS program. Your internship at a startup can also help you, if the work done is good.\n\nThe main point to understand is at the end of the day, work matters.\n\n5) If you have research papers or some academic awards or grants, then it will help you pass through a good MS program. Publishing researh papers does not mean that a person publishes 10 papers, but the conference or journal is not even recognized. Even if you have a single paper, but from a reputed organization, then it is far better than ten.\n\n6) Contacts with foreign univeristy profesor. If you have any interaction with the professor of the college of your choice, then you have an edge.\n\n7) SOP -- A golden rule, write the truth and not stories.

How should I plan my preparation for the GRE?,100+ Answers,['GRE Preparation\nGraduate School Admission Tests and Exams\nGraduate Record Examination (GRE)\nGraduate School Admissions\nExam and Test Preparation\nExams and Tests\nHow should I plan my preparation for the GRE?'],"['GRE has three main components namely verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing. Your entire preparation process should revolve around acquiring good skills on these areas and mastering the concepts required.\nSome of the things which you can do to get the required concept clarity are\nQuantitative reasoning:\nThe best part about GRE Math is the absence of things which most of us hate in Math - The integral calculus, trigonometry and other complicated stuff. GRE Math is mostly things which you learned in junior/ high school - Things like interger properties, word problems (rate of work, speed, probability etc) which can be solved with basic common sense. Not much beyond that.\nWhat makes the GRE so tricky is the interpretation of the questions part. Once you figure out what the question is asking, the math involved is definitely easier than what you faced in your high school. In fact, it is more fun as you don\'t need to write down each and every step and show your teacher on how you arrived at your answer. You just need to pick an answer. In short, the math section just tests your ability to reason with numbers.\nVerbal reasoning:\nVerbal reasoning section is even more simple with there being only 3 question types - text completion, critical reasoning and reading comprehension. The preparation process should be fully focused on knowing specific strategies for cracking these questions rather than generic preparation advocated.\nFor example, use of flash cards for learning new words was very helpful in the earlier format of the test where antonyms and analogies were asked and there was more emphasis on rote learning of words. But, the current format focuses more on understanding not only the literal meaning of the words but also the metaphorical use of the word based on the context. For example, while the word \'opaque\' literally means \'not transparent\', it could also mean \'difficult to interpret or understand\' if used in the right context. Similarly, there are no questions asking you to identify any grammar errors. Grammar is important only for your essay writing section. Hence, it makes sense not to rely on these old fashioned methods advocated by coaching institutes but to just keep focusing on the 3 question types.\nAnalytical writing:\nAnalytical writing section asks you to write 2 essays - one on ""The Issue"" and the other on ""The Argument"". The major difference here is in the first essay you are asked to take a stand on a complex issue whereas in the second essay you are asked to dissect the logic behind an already taken stand or position.\nHow do I prepare for this? You just need to follow a simple routine and you are guaranteed to score well in this section.\nChoose - Structure - Write - Compare - Improve - Choose\nStep 1: You choose a topic where you already have some well written sample essays. You can pick these up either in the official site or from the many blogs available online.\nStep 2: Come up with a structure and an outline.\nStep 3: Write an essay by developing the structure and the outline.\nStep 4: Compare it with other essays written on the topic.\nStep 5: Rewrite your essay to improve it.\nStep 6: Go to Step 1.\n--------------------\nIf you do all of the above, you are going to definitely score well on your GRE.\nCheck out Magnus Prep\'s GRE Program if you are looking for some great mentors to help with your GRE preparation.\nCheers!', 'When I started preparing for GRE, I realized that though I was quite comfortable with Quantitative Section,  I was a total noob at Verbal, be it vocabulary or reading comprehension. I had precisely three months to prepare. I surfed through the net and found that the New GRE was ""context intensive"" unlike its older version which was ""vocabulary intensive"". In other words, it was your ""depth of knowledge"" in vocabulary and not the breadth that mattered, which meant I could cut short my target vocabulary bank from 4000 to 1500 but with a caveat that I had to learn those 1500 words inside out, their usage in context of the sentence, which included not just primary, but secondary and tertiary meanings.\n\nNote: Below is the study pattern that I followed and it worked for me, but this is not the only way, you can always modify it as per your style. This is more focused on verbal section as I was fairly comfortable in the quantitative section from the beginning. I hope it proves helpful to you as well.\n\n1. First Month: Conditioning\nAs Norman Lewis puts it, if the Vocabulary Bank is Calcium, then extensive reading is Vitamin D. There is no point in taking more and more calcium if you don\'t have sufficient Vitamin D to absorb it.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nWork out (don\'t just read, work it out with pencil) ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis. It has 45 sessions. Finish 15 sessions per week, roughly 1.5-2 hours per day.\nIn parallel, start reading one newspaper EXTENSIVELY. Read it inside out (of course there are some sections which are just not your type, you can leave out those 2-3 pages). I started reading Economic Times because I had an inclination for business news (and with all those graphs and pie charts, it inadvertently prepared me for Data Interpretation as well)\n\nFourth Week:\nTime for some extra Vitamin D. Pick up one novel (preferably a motivational one) and read it voraciously, just finish it off in one week and don\'t forget to mark the new words that you come across while reading. Initially, it will pose some difficulty to those who are not into reading. I myself had a bitter start but a good novel will absorb you into it as you proceed. (I read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, it took me 12 days and yes, it really pumped me up)\nMeanwhile, continue with the newspaper DAILY.\n\nSo, it\'s been one month now. Don\'t expect anything from yourself yet. By this time, you have a cursory vocabulary bank of 400-500 words and through extensive reading of newspaper and a novel, you have conditioned yourself for the next phase.\n\n2. Second Month: Hitting the Bull\'s Eye=>The typical ""GRE"" way\nNow it\'s time to learn some real vocabulary, for the next three weeks, don\'t think of anything else but vocabulary. There are three different sources for high and medium frequency words that I\'m going to mention below, but the good thing is, most of the words from these word lists overlap.\n\nFirst Three Weeks:\nSign up at Vocabulary.com. Select the Vocabulary.com Top 1000 and click on ""Learn this list"" which offers objective type practice questions. It\'s a good habit to practice these words after signing in as they keep a track of your learning curve and offer you the practice questions accordingly.\nJoin the New GRE group on Facebook. It\'s the most active GRE group on Facebook right now. It will help you in two ways:\nMembers post random GRE questions on this group, which will give you a rough idea of how the questions are going to be while you are still in the Vocabulary building phase.\nSecondly, it\'s a good source to prepare for quantitative section. As long as you are able to solve the math problems being posted over there, you can care-freely concentrate on your verbal preparation.\nYou\'ll get access to some really USEFUL links.\nThe next source of vocabulary that I referred to was 1500 Words from http://Majortests.com , shuffle between this and http://Vocabulary.com.\nThe last but the ""first"" source is again, the word list at the end of ""Word Power Made Easy"". Meanwhile, don\'t forget to read the newspaper EXTENSIVELY, especially the Editorials.\nNow you are at a stage where you have a ""faint"" vocabulary word bank of 1500+ words, an extensive reading experience of a daily newspaper, a high-speed read novel and a fair idea of the level of verbal and quantitative GRE questions through Facebook group. Enough with the ""Vocabulary Only"" days, now it\'s time for some real action !!\nFourth Week\nTime to pick up the GRE preparations books: Now that you have enough vocabulary and reading habit in your armory, its time to use this raw material and shape it to fit the GRE examination pattern. Start with Official GRE by ETS. It will give you a clear idea of the pattern of the exam, but that\'s all its useful for. Don\'t expect it to be sufficient for practice problems. This week, just do (work out) this book, read news paper and nothing else. Also, keep a check on your performance while attempting sample problems in this book and identify your weakness: Is it RC or multiple blanks/synonyms\n\n3. Third month: Reach the top speed, end the preparation like a sprint racer\n\nFirst Two Weeks\nPick up Manhattan 5 lb, practice ALL the verbal exercises, don\'t leave a single question unanswered. Frankly speaking, once you are in momentum, these questions are not time consuming, either you know the answer, which is great, or you don\'t, which you can just look up in the answer key quickly. I stumbled upon the maths section of 5 lb, I liked it, it had all those problems which, though simple, are little tricky and trap you with wrong answer. I practiced quant from this book which prepared me to be ready with these kind of tricky questions. Then you can go through Kaplan GRE practice book, its a small e-book, wouldn\'t take much time but having finished two books will give you immense confidence and speed in problem solving. Another ""thin"" book that I quickly skimmed through (I\'m telling you, once you are in momentum, these books will pass through in a fly) 1014 Practive Questions for the new GRE-The Princeton Review. You can also pick up books 7 and 8 from Manhattan GRE 1-8 series for RC and Sentence completion respectively.\n\nLast Two Weeks\nIts time to pick up what we have been letting off till now: AWA and Exam Practice Tests. For AWA, I\'d read samples from Manhattan AWA. I really like the way they break down the technique to answer the AWA section, which makes it really easy to structure your thought. For more random RC practice with a timer, just visit Codecoax.com and it will pop up an RC for you. Lastly, practice as much full length exams as you can with TIMER. Practice atleast 5. For full length tests, here are some links that you can visit:\n\n20 online tests\n\n800Score\'s Free Full Length Revised GRE Test\n\nMyGRETutor\'s 4 free Full Length Tests\n\nKaplan\'s Free Practice Test Options for the GRE\n\nPrinceton Review: Free GRE Full length test\n\nIts easy ! Its doable !! Just do it !!!\n\nOriginally answered here: How to score 330+ in GRE in 3 months ?', 'Quant - 170 Verbal- 164 AWA- 4.5/6\nI recently gave my GRE on 28th September 2017. Although I started my preparation 3 months prior to the examination I could not continue due to the fact that I am also preparing for other competitive exams. Also I was put down by Chicken pox and Typhoid for a month. Effectively I had little more than a month to prepare for the test. So I was quite surprised with the result that I got as you can see above. Here is how I prepared for my GRE test.\nStudy Material -\nMagoosh GRE prep account (most important)\nMagoosh Vocabulary builder (words flashcard app)\nManhattan prep GRE 5 lb. book of gre practice problems\nManhattan GRE Prep Reading comprehension and Essay\nOfficial Guide for GRE by ETS (all three books)\nVarious news sites such as The New Yorker , The Economist etc. ( as prescribed on Magoosh GRE blog).\nStudy Plan -\nI started my preparation at the start of the month of July . As I told earlier I am also studying for other competitive exams so I could’nt devote much time to GRE. I studied for maximum 3 hours each day. I also did’nt study according to any plan. Some days it was only vocab building by flashcards and reading articles. Some days it was practicing problems Some days divided between both. Also I watched Magoosh GRE video lessons and I can say they were very useful.\nThis is a tip for students from engineering background preparing for GRE. Don’t ignore the quantitative section even if it seems easy to you. Practice it as you would the verbal section.\nAfter recovering from my maladies I had approx 5 weeks to prepare for GRE. So I decided to tidy up my routine so\nI increased my GRE study time to 5–6 hours per day\nIn a day I would first go through my magoosh flashcards and try to learn atleast 30 new words per day and also revise a few old words. Also I made a point to read and understand atleast 2 news articles per day .\nThen I would practice quantitative for approx 1 hour . I generally used timed custom practice test in Magoosh GRE account.\nFor next 2 hours I would go through practicing the verbal section and writing essays.\nI learnt how to read the paragraphs swiftly and in detail. Again Magoosh video lessons were very important in this regard.\nUnfortunately I was not able to give any full practice test due to my surroundings but I would recommend everyone to give atleast one of them.\nMy main focus was on improving my vocab by learning new words , their meaning and context of their uses as it appeared to me to be very useful for Sentence equivalence and Text completion questions. Again and I cannot stress this enough watching Magoosh video lessons was very important.\nI practiced and practiced as much as my schedule allowed me to.\nOn the day of the examination\nReach the centre atleast 1 hour prior to the commencement of test as there are plenty of verification to be done before the examination. Also carry a water bottle with you. GRE is very attentively conducted examination and staff of testing centres are very vigilant. If you have any problem feel free to ask for their help.\nGRE is a very easy exam as you can see in my case , with a directed and concentrated approach you can score very well ( 330+) within a relatively short amount of prep time.\nBe well , Be prepared and best of luck.', 'I’ve been tutoring the GRE for a number of years. The below is inspired by the many sessions I’ve had with students, many of whom have gone on to do very well on the GRE. A lot of it is also specific to the revised GRE, which made its debut in August 2011.\n \n1. Use official material\n \nWhen preparing for the GRE, no questions prepare you better than the ones written by ETS, which is responsible for writing the questions you will see test day. As much as possible, stick to the questions in the Official Guide to the GRE so you can wrap your mind around how the test writers want you to reason.\n \nYou may not think that it makes that much of a difference, but many publishers out there have questions that require you to make certain leaps of logic—or employ questionable logic—that you will never have to do on the actual test. Then there is the fact that many questions simply aren’t as difficult or nuanced as the questions you’ll see test day. This is a problem many students encounter when using Kaplan—you are essentially taking a dumbed down version of the GRE, with often poorly constructed questions to boot.\n \n\n2. Take practice tests\n \nThere is no better way to prepare for test day than actually taking a mock test. You will train yourself to sit for three plus hours staring at a screen, as you are pummeled by an onslaught of GRE problems.\n \nIf possible, use only the official tests, found in the Official Guide to the New GRE. There are four such tests—two that comes with the book, and two that are computer-based and come with the CD that is part of the book. Stagger these out  over the four weeks you are prepping, so that there are no fewer than five days between tests and no more than ten days. If you are studying longer, you might also want to consider Manhattan GRE tests (see below).\n \nFinally, practice tests will allow you to better assess your strengths and weaknesses, and help inform your study sessions in between tests.\n \n \n3. Focus on weaknesses\n \nMake sure not to get carried away developing those areas in which you already excel. For instance, if you are generally strong at math problem solving questions, but if you dislike Data Interpretation (that’s the section with all the graphs), then the last thing you want to do is avoid that section. Instead make it a priority to become confident and effective at all questions relating to Data Interpretation.\n \n \n4. Use the best material\n \nWhile official material is clearly the best prep out there, it doesn’t necessarily provide the most effective strategies. You may want to take a look at Princeton Review for helpful big picture strategies. As for specific strategies for almost every aspect of the GRE—from permutations to convoluted paragraph arguments—the Manhattan GRE books (MGRE) are the best. MGRE also has six practice tests that mimic the actual test very well (though this more so with math than with verbal). For more practice on the online format, Magoosh also offers questions that are similar to--and often more difficult--than those found on the actual test. (I should probably mention that I work for Magoosh :))\n \nOf course there is a lot of material out there that should be avoided, especially in terms of practice content.
